indian oil firm eyes yukos assets

indias biggest oil exploration firm oil & natural gas corp ongc says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled russian crude producer yukos

we are in touch with the concerned russian entities about the yukos assets and other opportunities in russia said ongc chairman subir raha local press had reported that ongc was looking to buy 15% of yukos former key oil production unit for 2bn 1bn yukos is being broken up by russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill

it was forced to sell its key production unit yuganskneftegas yugansk last month after being hit with a bill of 27bn in unpaid taxes and fines

stateowned rosneft now owns yugansk and russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a standalone firm indian oil minister mani shankar aiyar discussed ongcs plans during a trip to moscow last year and the topic came up again during russian president vladimir putins recent visit to new delhi it would make great sense for us to build on that said mr aiyar indias oil production has stagnated over recent years and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies india imports about 70% of its total oil consumption at the same time indias economy is booming and the countrys thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide

india produces about 793000 barrels of oil per day bpd little changed since the start of the 1990s according to oil industry analysts douglaswestwood consumption meanwhile has jumped to 24 million bpd compared with 474000 bpd in 1973

for countries to develop they have to have access to energy said john westwood managing director of oil industry analysts douglaswestwood india is a dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil by buying into yugansk ongc would be able to reduce its dependence on gulf states for oil imports mr westwood explained especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within india are slim we forecast that indian production will go into significant decline mr westwood said by 2020 production may only be at half of todays levels ongc which is majorityowned by the indian state already has bought petroleum assets in countries including vietnam sudan and russia the company is a partner with rosneft in the sakhalin1 oil field off russias siberian coast

ongc is however not the only firm interested in yugansk

chinese crude company china national petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor while on thursday italy refused to rule out an interest ongcs interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the worlds biggest oil producers brought to its knees the dispute is partly driven by president putins clampdown on the political ambitions of exyukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion yukos has been battling the russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without yugansk on thursday a us court said it will hear arguments for yukos bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 february should that happen yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets analysts said
