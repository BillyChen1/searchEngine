high fuel prices hit bas profits

british airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits

reporting its results for the three months to 31 december 2004 the airline made a pretax profit of 75m 141m compared with 125m a year earlier rod eddington bas chief executive said the results were respectable in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by 106m or 473% bas profits were still better than market expectation of 59m and it expects a rise in fullyear revenues

to help offset the increased price of aviation fuel ba last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers

in october it increased this from 6 to 10 oneway for all longhaul flights while the shorthaul surcharge was raised from 250 to 4 a leg yet aviation analyst mike powell of dresdner kleinwort wasserstein says bas estimated annual surcharge revenues  160m  will still be way short of its additional fuel costs  a predicted extra 250m turnover for the quarter was up 43% to 197bn further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue looking ahead to its full year results to march 2005 ba warned that yields  average revenues per passenger  were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from lowcost carriers however it said sales would be better than previously forecast for the year to march 2005 the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 35% improvement anticipated ba chairman martin broughton said ba had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in fullyear revenue

it also reported on friday that passenger numbers rose 81% in january aviation analyst nick van den brul of bnp paribas described bas latest quarterly results as pretty modest it is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development however operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong he said since the 11 september 2001 attacks in the united states ba has cut 13000 jobs as part of a major costcutting drive our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products mr eddington said for example we have taken delivery of six airbus a321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our club world flat beds bas shares closed up four pence at 2745 pence
