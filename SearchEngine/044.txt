japan economy slides to recession

the japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade

gross domestic product fell by 01% in the last three months of 2004 the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters the tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year on wednesday the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which when taking into account performance in the most recent period effectively tips japan into recession

a previous estimate of 01% growth between july and september was downgraded to a 03% decline a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth although the japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy

figures released by the governments cabinet office showed that gdp on an annualised basis fell 05% in the last three months of 2004 however politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year the economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture it is in a recovery stage said economic and fiscal policy minister heizo takenaka gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country the economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at gdp alone mr takenaka stressed

ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by oneoff factors such as the unseasonably mild winter analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that japans largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise japans economy grew 26% overall last year  fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months  and is forecast to see growth of 21% in 2005 however the economys fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldnt be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy said naoki iizuka senior economist at the daiichi life research institute japans economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession
