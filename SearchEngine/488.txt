us budget deficit to reach 368bn

the us budget deficit is set to hit a worsethanexpected 368bn 197bn this year officials said on tuesday

the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further 100bn in the red past congressional budget office cbo forecasts said there would be a 348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year in recent months the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits in november the gap between us exports and imports widened to more than 60bn a record figure the cbo says it envisages a further orderly decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away but the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost us economic growth

the budget deficit hit a record 412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004 after reaching 377bn in the previous fiscal year the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of 855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015 an improvement on previous projections however analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential 238 trillion costs of the presidents plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts the figure could also be worsened by any further military costs republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan one of president george w bushs election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraqrelated costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit a charge which the administration denies on tuesday the us administration asked congress for additional funds for military operations
