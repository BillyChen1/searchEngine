market unfazed by aurora setback

as the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe

the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble and its owner p&o cruises  now part of the huge us carnival corporation  was looking at a significant slice chopped off this years profits and a potential pr fiasco noone however seems to have told the stock markets the warning of a fivecent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the worlds biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnivals share price from 35 to 3620 other investors barely blinked and by 1300 gmt carnivals shares in london were down a single penny or 003% at 3226

why the mismatch between the public perception and the markets response the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time says deutsche banks simon champion it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company  it was a long cruise after all but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as oneoff events

despite its string of bad luck he pointed out aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet the uks p&o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003 and generally speaking carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule carnival has an incredibly strong track record mr champion

similarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise that should mitigate some of the pr risk both for carnival and its main competitor royal caribbean while not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday moreover such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises after all the aurora incident may be big news in the uk  but for carnival customers elsewhere its unlikely to make too much of a splash

assuming that citigroup is right and demand stays solid the structure of the industry also works in carnivals favour in the wake of p&o princesss takeover by carnival the business is now to a great extent a duopoly given the expense of building outfitting and running a cruise ship slowing supply growth is a certainty said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday in other words if you do want a cruise your options are limited and with carnival remaining the market leader it looks set to keep selling the tickets  no matter what happens to the illfated aurora in the future
