india seeks to boost construction

india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector

kamal nath commerce and industry minister announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting analysts say improving indias infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too the indian governments decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some indian firms

a spokesman for dlf builders dr vancheshwar told the bbc this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders he said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice

the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the automatic route in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board which can be bureaucratic the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brickmaking industries

mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50000 square meters 538000 square feet within a specific timeframe said mr nath without specifying the timeframe previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area discouraging some from entering the indian market this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it anshuman magazine managing director of cb richard ellis  an international real estate company  told the bbc this was a big positive step

however chittabrata majumdar general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions citu said allowing fdi in the country is compromising indias own self reliance he said no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country  in terms of employment and money generated  or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets
