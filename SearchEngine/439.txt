german economy rebounds

gross domestic product gdp rose by 17% last year the statistical office said the economy contracted in 2003 foreign sales increased by 82% last year compared with a 03% slide in private consumption concerns remain however over the strength of the euro weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market the european central bank ecb left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on thursday it is the nineteenth month in a row that the ecb has not moved borrowing costs economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005 with growth set to sputter rather than ignite
