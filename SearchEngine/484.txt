uk young top euro earnings league

british children enjoy the highest average annual income in europe  more than double that of spanish or italian youngsters a report suggests

children in the uk between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of 775 said market analyst datamonitor they use pester power to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income the report said as for how they spend their cash the bulk goes on personal care soft drinks and food datamonitor said

datamonitor adds that british teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs  the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality

british teenage girls compared to their counterparts in seven european countries are the most keen to use makeup products nearly three out of four girls said they used makeup according to the datamonitor report the trend marked british teenagers out as particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form longterm beauty routines and the good times are likely to keep rolling for british children as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008
