profits stall at chinas lenovo

profits at chinese computer firm lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition

the firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the pc division of personal computer pioneer ibm lenovos profit for the three months to december was hk327m us42m; 22m less than 1% up on the year before chinese pc sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years but are now growing more slowly the company is still by far the biggest player in china with more than a quarter of the market but western firms such as dell and hewlettpackard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in china and lenovos sales were down 37% by revenue to hk631bn

if the 175bn agreement lenovo signed with ibm on 8 december goes through it will mark the end of an era ibm pioneered the desktop pc market in the early 1980s although strategic missteps helped lose it its early dominance in any case margins in pc market are now wafer thin and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except directsales giant dell but investors have been less than impressed with lenovos move designed to take it out of china and further onto the world stage its shares are down 20% since the announcement two months ago largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying there have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because us government agencies fear it could offer china opportunities for industrial espionage the reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent lenovos shares up 6% in late january
