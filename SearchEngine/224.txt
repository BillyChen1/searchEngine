man utd to open books to glazer

manchester uniteds board has agreed to give us tycoon malcolm glazer access to its books

earlier this month mr glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club in a statement the club said it would allow mr glazer limited due diligence to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid but it said it continued to oppose mr glazers plans calling his assumptions aggressive and his plan damaging many of manchester uniteds supporters own shares in the club and the fanbased group shareholders united is strongly opposed to any takeover by mr glazer about 300 fans protested outside the old trafford ground two days ago

rival local club manchester city has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on sunday

manchester uniteds response comes as little surprise as the board made clear any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal the club said in its statement should it become a firm offer it should be at a price that the board is likely to regard as fair and on terms which may be deliverable but it also stressed that it stayed opposed to mr glazers proposal the board continues to believe that mr glazers business plan assumptions are aggressive the statement said and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms in the case of manchester united many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons at present mr glazer and his family hold a 281% stake making them manchester uniteds second biggest shareholders they own the successful tampa bay buccaneers american football team based in florida if the family makes a formal offer they will need the support of the clubs biggest shareholders

irish horse racing millionaires jp mcmanus and john magnier own 29% of united through their investment vehicle cubic expression and have yet to express a view on the bid approach

a group of five mps are calling on the department of trade and industry to block any takeover of the club by the us football magnate on public interest grounds they have signed a house of commons motion and tony lloyd the manchester central mp whose constituency includes the clubs old trafford ground has pledged to take the matter to tony blair if necessary the commons motion says any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football however the dti has dismissed the proposal a spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the enterprise act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on noncompetition grounds mr glazers offer values the club at 800m 15bn pitched at 300p per share it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the us tycoon which was rejected out of hand manchester united shares closed at 27025p on friday down 375p on the day
