optimism remains over uk housing

the uk property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown according to mortgage lender bradford & bingley and housebuilder george wimpey

b&b said the buytolet market  in which the bank is a major player  would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market the comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to 2802m 532m wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to 4507m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected

recent housing market surveys have indicated that the uk property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth last week figures from the council of mortgage lenders cml indicated that the popularity of buytolet mortgages  a key phenomenon of the housing boom  could be waning

but b&b  which has a 22% share of the uk buytolet mortgage market  said that while rates of growth were moderating the sector continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market overall b&b said that housing market fundamentals remain strong interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the mediumterm despite the upbeat tone shares in b&b were down more than 4% at 3255p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth

wimpeys profit figures came in at the top of expectations with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the us offsetting a slight slowdown in the uk wimpey said the uk housing market had proved challenging last year by late summer the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn it added however the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs wimpey said visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations shares in wimpey were up 6% at 4585p in morning trade
