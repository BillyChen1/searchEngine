saab to build cadillacs in sweden

general motors the worlds largest car maker has confirmed that it will build a new mediumsized cadillac bls at its lossmaking saab factory in sweden

the car unveiled at the geneva motor show is intended to compete in the mediumsized luxury car market it will not be sold in the us said gm europe president carlpeter forster as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine

gms announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factorys closure the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gms planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations but the groups new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the groups opel workers in ruesselsheim germany they may now have to face a larger proportion of gms cuts

neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden since it reflects saabs failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market for years saab has consistently said it is competing headon with bmw mercedes and jaguar the segments leaders do not agree

gms plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers in the us it has long been established as an upmarket brand  even the presidential limousine carries the badge yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe other luxury car makers most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe there german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market

bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperatelyneeded scale to the saab factory which currently produces fewer than 130000 cars per year that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and saab is losing money fast  albeit with losses halved in 2004 to 200m 104m; 151m euros from 500m the previous year beyond the 12000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs opels  badged as vauxhalls in the uk  and now cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts another way to further reduce saabs losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news the current trend towards us production was stupid he said

in a separate announcement gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models it is to deploy a fleet of 35000 test cars across 40 countries inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24hours it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us gm said it wanted to change customers perceptions about opel and vauxhall cars showing them that the quality had improved in recent years
