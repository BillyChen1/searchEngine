yukos heading back to us courts

russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival

the firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a 27bn 14bn tax bill yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas the unit was however sold for 94bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted

yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law the company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets using all and every legal means the company wants damages of 20bn claiming yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value judge letitia clark will hear different motions including one from deutsche bank to throw out the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing the german lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to gazprom the russian stateowned company that was expected to win the auction for yuganskneftegas deutsche bank which is also an advisor to gazprom has called on the us court to overturn its decision to provide yukos with bankruptcy protection

lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify deutsche banks business position analysts said

analysts are not optimistic about yukos chances in court russian president vladimir putin and the countrys legal authorities have repeatedly said that the us has no jurisdiction over yukos and its legal wranglings on top of that the firm only has limited assets in the us yukos has won small victories however and is bullish about its chances in court do we have an ability to influence what happens we think we do said mike lake a yukos spokesman the litigation risks are real said credit suisse first boston analyst vadim mitroshin the dispute with the russian authorities is partly driven by president putins clampdown on the political ambitions of exyukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion
