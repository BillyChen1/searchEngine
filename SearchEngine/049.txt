bmw cash to fuel mini production

less than four years after the new mini was launched german car maker bmw has announced 100m of new investment

some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200000 cars from 2007 the rise from 189000 last year is a response to rapidlyrising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists before wednesdays announcement bmw had invested some 280m in mini production

since its launch during summer 2001 the new mini has gone from strength to strength

last year almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away said norbert reithofer a member of the bmw management board initially bmw said it would produce 100000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford but the target was quickly reached then raised time and time again not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue the risk is that after theyve invested massively in the brand demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle said brad wernle from automotive news europe

the price of the car has also gone up when it was launched the cheapest mini cost just more than 10000 these days buyers will have to fork out almost 11500 to own a new mini one or even more for the cooper s which costs up to 17730 the mini convertible which was launched last spring costs up to 15690 for the top model and there is even a waiting list secondhand minis are not cheap either a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least 8000 for the cheapest model while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from 12556 according to thecar buying website parkers the consumers association which operates with slightly different numbers yet it confirms that the mini cooper 16 depreciates slower than any other car other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se

the cowley factory which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100000 minis is increasingly being put to good use

there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans bmws mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for 10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium in 1999 when bmw still owned rover the oxford factory was producing the awardwinning rover 75 during that year 3500 people produced 56000 cars last year in the same factory almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4500 miniworkers the mini factorys current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge which in 1999 produced 180000 rover cars last year mg rover which employs more than 6000 people produced just 110000 cars though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation saic that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge indeed mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford are taken into account
