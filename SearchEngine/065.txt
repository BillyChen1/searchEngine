eu aiming to fuel development aid

european union finance ministers meet on thursday to discuss proposals including a tax on jet fuel to boost development aid for poorer nations

the policy makers are to ask for a report into how more development money can be raised the eu said the worlds richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 07% of their annual gross national income by 2015 airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy

profits have been under pressure in the airline industry with lowcost firms driving down prices and demand dipping after the 11 september terrorist attacks and the outbreak of the killer sars virus

things have picked up but some european researchers and us companies are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy at present the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives but why target the airlines said ulrich schultestrathaus secretary general of the association of european airlines our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisisonly to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs he continued

the eu sought to allay the airlines fears stressing that thursdays meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration it added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines the eu said there is thought to be widespread support for the plan  tabled by france and germany following the recent g7 meeting of the worlds richest nations  from eu ministers the issue of poverty in africa and south asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done at their meeting in london g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the worlds poorest countries
