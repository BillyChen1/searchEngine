wmc says xstrata bid is too low

australian mining firm wmc resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 74bn australian dollar 58bn; 3bn bid by rival xstrata

there is now pressure on swissbased xstrata to increase its takeover offer a report from investment firm grant samuel in wmc defence documents values wmc shares at a717 to a824 against xstratas bid of a635 a share analysts said the defence documents provided more details on wmc and may trigger a possible rival bid if a bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks said daiwa securities analyst mark pervan he said the valuation would put increased pressure on xstrata to look at sweetening its offer marc gonsalves an executive at xstrata said: we will review the information contained in the targets statement over the next week or so he added: while we will review the assumptions made by grant samuel in detail we are extremely sceptical of their conclusion and suggest that wmc shareholders take extreme care in presuming that these optimistic assumptions are capable of being realised

last month australias competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of wmc by zurich and londonbased xstrata on tuesday wmc chairman tommie bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders best interest to reject the offer he said wmc would pursue valuecreating options provided by a portfolio of world class assets and wmc chief executive andrew michelmore claimed the xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for xstratas shareholders and was not being made for the benefit of wmcs shareholders grant samuel said its valuation of wmc was based on lower average prices for nickel copper and uranium than current market levels any longer term commodity price improvements would only improve our outlook mr michelmore said

in 2003 xstrata acquired australias largest copper miner  mim holdings wmc resources is the worlds thirdlargest producer of concentrated nickel and also a miner of copper and uranium it owns the olympic dam mine in south australia which contains about onethird of the worlds known uranium resources and is also the worlds fourth largest copper mine xstrata is a global mining giant with operations in australia south africa spain germany argentina and the uk its core products are copper coking coal thermal coal ferrochrome vanadium and zinc it also has growing businesses in gold lead and silver
