turkey turns on the economic charm

three years after a gruelling economic crisis turkey has dressed its economy to impress

as part of a charm offensive  ahead of 17 december when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks  turkeys economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements the economy is growing fast they insist education levels among its young and large population are rising unemployment levels in percentage terms are heading fast towards single digits inflation is under control a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to 21bn 108bn in three years

moreover government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract 15bn of foreign investment over the next three years a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund imf is pretty much in the can and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent

the point of all this has been to convince europes decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits

the cake will be bigger for everybody said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget if admitted into the eu turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros 8bn; 6bn to its budget by 2014 according to a recent impact study by the countrys state planning organisation as turkeys gross domestic output gdp is set to grow by 6% per year on average its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020 turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in old europe once its population comes of age by 2014 one in four turks  or about 18 million people  will be aged 14 or less a literate and qualified turkish population insisted mr sener will make a positive impact on the eu

this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers wallets however turkeys assertions are confirmed by brussels own impact studies which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy but only over time costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkeys membership with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 165bn euros and according to some predictions balloon to 335bn euros this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid though such payments should decline as the countrys farm sector which currently employs one in three turks would employ just one in five by 2020

such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkeys government would never be delivered say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned

some fear that rather than providing an educated sophisticated labour force for europe at large the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor uneducated  and plentiful more recently less palatable concerns  at least in liberal european circles  have been voiced with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a river of islam an oriental culture and a threat to europes cultural richness of course many opponents are politically motivated  their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the countrys muslim traditions to welldocumented concerns about the governments human rights record yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand

critics insist that much of the optimism about turkeys economic roadmap has been overegged  an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the countrys current account deficit to 107bn during the first 10 months of this year

the countrys massive debt  which includes 23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets  also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu in the new member states of the european union gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product says reza moghadam assistant director of the imfs european department at about 80% of gdp turkeys gross debt is double that figure turkeys debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the countrys devastating recession there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past it remains quite vulnerable says michael deppler director of the imfs european department its debt is far too high for an emerging economy a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria but economics is not a science and although the state of turkeys economy is important as is its pace of reform the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will of course be guided by their political instincts
