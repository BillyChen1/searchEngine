golden rule boost for chancellor

chancellor gordon brown has been given a 21bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule which allows him to borrow only for investment

the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government

a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by double counting some spending on roads since 19989 correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment thus helping mr brown to meet his golden rule of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle economists speculated that it might also allow for some votecatching measures in the budget

the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by 21bn in total mr letwin said: this is a very murky area there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual 105bn black hole in the nations coffers but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions

in january the independent institute for fiscal studies ifs said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last years budget it also said the government might narrowly miss its golden rule if the current economic cycle ended in 200506 after the ons announcement economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 200405 of about 400m none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years said jonathan loynes chief uk economist at capital economics accordingly it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course
