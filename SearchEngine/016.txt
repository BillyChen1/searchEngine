china keeps tight rein on credit

chinas efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005 state media report

the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system growth in china remains at a breakneck 91% and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year rapid toolingup of chinas manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy  one of the factors which has kept world oil prices skyhigh for most of this year in theory the government has a 7% growth target but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a hard landing in the shape of an overbalancing economy a low exchange rate  chinas yuan is pegged to a rate of 828 to the dollar which seems to be in relentless decline  means chinese exports are cheap on world markets china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg to some extent the credit controls do seem to be taking effect industrial output grew 157% in the year to october down from 23% in february and inflation slowed to 43%  although retail sales are still booming
