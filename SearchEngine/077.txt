china had role in yukos splitup

china lent russia 6bn 32bn to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos it has been revealed

the kremlin said on tuesday that the 6bn which russian state bank veb lent stateowned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a longterm oil supply deal with china the deal sees rosneft receive 6bn in credits from chinas cnpc

according to russian newspaper vedomosti these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk reports said cnpc had been offered 20% of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a longterm oil supply deal instead analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos yugansks former owner if cnpc had become a shareholder rosneft and veb declined to comment the two companies rosneft and cnpc have agreed on the prepayment for longterm deliveries said russian oil official sergei oganesyan there is nothing unusual that the prepayment is for five to six years

the announcements help to explain how rosneft a mediumsized indebted and relatively unknown firm was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk yugansk was sold for 93bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a 27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines

the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky once the countrys richest man mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion

the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of chinas desire to secure longterm oil supplies to feed its booming economy chinas thirst for products such as crude oil copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage in russia said dmitry lukashov an analyst at brokerage aton they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies if the price of oil is fixed under the deal which is unlikely it could be very profitable for the chinese mr lukashov continued and rosneft is in desperate need of cash so its a good deal for them too
