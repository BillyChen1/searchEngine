air passengers win new eu rights

air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation

new eu rules set compensation at between 250 euros 173 and 600 euros depending on the length of the flight the new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights including budget airlines airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost the european commission is facing two legal challenges  one from the european lowfare airlines association elaa and the other from the international air transport association iata which has attacked the package as a bad piece of legislation previously passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding

however only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations

the eu decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights overbooking can often lead to bumping  when a passenger is moved to a later flight when this happens against a passengers will airlines will now have to offer compensation in addition if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline all passengers must be paid compensation

however airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to extraordinary circumstances airlines fear that extraordinary circumstances may not include bad weather security alerts or strikes  events which are outside of their control all eubased airlines and operators of flights which take off from the eu will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on thursday lowcost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels arguing that the payout could be worth more than the ticket its a preposterous piece of legislation we among all airlines are fighting this ryanair deputy chief executive michael cawley told radio 4s today programme

the european regions airline association eraa claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes andy clarke eraa director of air transport said that the ec advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather

ec spokeswoman marja quillinanmeiland conceded there were grey areas but said these are not as big as the airlines are making out in cases of dispute national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case she said new technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather she added the eraas mr clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules the extra costs would be passed onto passengers we reckon its going to cost european air passengers  not the airlines the airlines have no money it has to be paid by passengers  15bn euros thats over 1bn a year loaded onto european passengers mr clarke said thats basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted

on wednesday jacques barrot vice president of the european commission and also commissioner for transport said that the changes were necessary the boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers right this is a concrete example of how the union benefits peoples daily lives he added the ec has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights
