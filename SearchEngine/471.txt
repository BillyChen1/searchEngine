tsunami slows sri lankas growth

sri lankas president has launched a reconstruction drive worth 35bn 18bn by appealing for peace and national unity

president kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict meanwhile the international monetary fund imf said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from sri lankas economic growth this year it estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 65% of the economy

separately the international labour organisation ilo said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in sri lanka and indonesia alone it called for action to create jobs president kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of hambantota she was joined by government and opposition politicians together with buddhist hindu muslim and christian clergy

prime minister mahinda rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6000 homes for survivors of the tsunami mrs kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation we are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully instead we have been squabbling fighting she added norways peace negotiator erik solheim is due to arrive on wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decadeslong conflict between government forces and the tamil tigers who want a separate state in the north east of the country reconstruction efforts in eastern sri lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides

the imf said that the sri lankan authorities initial estimates have put the physical damage at 13 to 15bn but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this the broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage the imf said growth inflation the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs the fishing industry has been devastated agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer especially in the short term the report said the ilo estimated that 400000 sri lankans have lost their jobs mostly in these three industries earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year economic growth this year is expected to be 4% which is about 1% less than previously forecast inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12% although major exports have not suffered the imf expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments foreign exchange reserves may become strained as sri lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pretsunami level which totalled more than two months worth of imports last week the imf approved sri lankas request for a freeze on loan repayments
