us trade gap ballooned in october

the us trade deficit widened by more than expected in october hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs figures have shown

the trade shortfall was 555bn 29bn up 9% from september the commerce department said that pushed the 10 month deficit to 5005bn imports rose by 34% while exports increased by only 06% a weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports though this should help drive export demand in coming months things are getting worse but thats to be expected said david wyss of standard & poors in new york the first thing is that when the dollar goes down it increases the price of imports we are seeing improved export orders things seem to be going in the right direction

despite this optimism significant concerns remain as to how the us will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with china which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports the us imported almost 20bn worth of goods from china during october exporting a little under 3bn it seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains said anthony crescenzi a bond strategist at miller tabak in new york the trade deficit and the shortfall with china are big issues going forward the commerce department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 225% at a fed meeting later on tuesday
