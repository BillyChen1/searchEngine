euus seeking deal on air dispute

the eu and us have agreed to begin talks on ending subsidies given to aircraft makers eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has announced

both sides hope to reach a negotiated deal over state aid received by european aircraft maker airbus and its us rival boeing mr mandelson said airbus and boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies mr mandelson said the eu and us hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the world trade organisation wto

with this agreement the eu and us have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which has arisen between them mr mandelson said i hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft last year the us terminated an agreement with the eu reached in 1992 which limits the subsidies countries can hand over to civil aircraft makers the us filed a complaint against brussels with the wto over state aid to airbus prompting a retaliatory eu complaint over us support for boeing however both sides agreed to suspend their requests for wto arbitration at the beginning of december to allow bilateral talks to continue eads and bae systems the european defence and aerospace firms which own airbus welcomed mr mandelsons announcement it has always been preferable that any differences between the us and europe on this matter be overcome through constructive discussion rather than through legal recourse the companies said in a joint statement

separately the worlds largest package delivery company ups said it had placed an order for 10 airbus a380 superjumbo freightcarrying jets with an option to buy 10 more of the tripledecker aircraft the us company said it needed to expand its air freight capacity following strong international growth and would begin receiving deliveries of the a380s from 2009 however ups said it was cutting a previous order for smaller airbus a300s from 90 planes to 53 so far airbus has delivered 40 a300s to ups airbus overtook boeing as the worlds largest manufacturer of commercial airliners in 2003
