bush to outline toughest budget

president bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the us congress seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit

about 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a 25 trillion 13 trillion package aimed at curbing the giant us budget deficit defence spending will rise however while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in iraq vicepresident dick cheney said the budget was the tightest so far

at the heart of the administrations fifth budget presented to congress on monday is an austere package of domestic measures these would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation

such belttightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of president bushs first term mr cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the bush presidency but argued it was fair and responsible it is not something we have done with a meat axe nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society he said the wars in iraq and afghanistan increased expenditure on national security after 911 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by president bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit the shortfall is projected to rise to 427bn in 2005

education environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to 230bn by 2009

most controversially the government is seeking to cut the medicaid budget which provides health care to the nations poorest by 45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by 587m spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase although not by as much as originally planned president bushs proposals would see the pentagons budget rise by 19bn to 4193bn while homeland security would get an extra 2bn

the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan for which the administration in expected to seek an extra 80bn from congress later this year

also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administrations radical proposed overhaul of social security provision some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to 45bn trillion over a twenty year period despite the republicans holding a majority in both houses of congress the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months

john mccain a republican senator said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit with the deficits that we are now running i am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget he said however democratic senator kent conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009 the cost of everything he president bush advocates explodes he said
