euro firms miss out on optimism

more than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects a survey of 1300 bosses suggests

their biggest worries are not terror threats but overregulation lowcost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices there is one exception: firms in western europe  but not the uk  are lacking confidence after years of slow growth when business advisers pricewaterhousecoopers pwc conducted the same survey two years ago nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects

global business leaders say that they are facing a twopronged regulatory assault after a string of corporate scandals in the united states  from enron to worldcom  the sarbanesoxley act forces companies to be much more transparent but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money across europe meanwhile all stock exchangelisted companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called ifrs hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with lowcost competitors

already about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into lowwage countries and another 11% plan to do so in the future possibly as a result the worry about lowcost competition has slightly fallen from last year with just 54% of companies calling it a significant threat or one of the biggest threats but pwcs global chief executive samuel dipiazza said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers

according to frank brown global advisory leader at pwc  the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: one risk in one region  for example the middle east  wont kill your business anymore surprisingly the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the us dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore unlike even a year ago when it was cited as the thirdlargest problem mr dipiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had adjusted to the new reality of a euro that buys 130 and more while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates


  for the survey pricewaterhousecoopers interviewed 1324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004
