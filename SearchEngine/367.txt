takeover offer for sunderland fc

bob murray chairman of sunderland fc has launched a 15m 28m bid for the club after buying broadcaster bskybs stake in the business

mr murray is already sunderlands leading shareholder holding a 376% stake and now hopes to take full control of the championship side mr murray said the club would find it easier to attract more investment by having a single majority owner sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in august

a lifetime sunderland supporter and board director since 1984 mr murray agreed to buy bskybs 476% holding in the wearside club on tuesday  taking his stake to 423% under stock market rules mr murray is required to make an offer for the remaining shares that he does not already own at the same price paid for the bskyb holding of 31p a share

should the offer be fully accepted mr murray said he expected to pay a maximum of 153m for the remaining shares he also stressed that fans who wanted to keep in touch with the clubs financial affairs could retain a small number of shares enabling them to attend annual meetings the football sector is experiencing significant changes and uncertainty mr murray said in a statement the recent speculation surrounding malcolm glazer and manchester united has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests he added i believe that this offer will strengthen the company and remove the potential for that type of uncertainty

sunderland were relegated from the premiership in 2003 but are currently pushing for promotion the club managed to reduce its losses last year from 206m to 12m after selling a host of leading players however the clubs turnover dropped sharply from 425m to 285m over the same period because of a fall in broadcast revenues bskyb bought its stake in sunderland in 1999 as part of a five year media partnership deal the deal expired last month
