boeing unveils new 777 aircraft

us aircraft firm boeing has unveiled its new longdistance 777 plane as it tries to regain its position as the industrys leading manufacturer

the 777200lr will be capable of flying almost 11000 miles nonstop linking cities such as london and sydney boeing in contrast to european rival airbus hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances airbus which overtook boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003 is focusing on socalled super jumbos

analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between boeing and airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry boeing plans to offer twinengine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the worlds airports getting rid of the need for connecting flights

it is banking on smaller slimmer planes such as the 777200lr and its muchanticipated 787 dreamliner plane which is set to take to the skies in 2008 the 777200lr which had its launch delayed by the 11 september attacks in the us is the fifth variation of boeings twinaisle 777 plane the company offically rolledout the new 777 in seattle at 2200 gmt better fuel efficiency from engines made by ge and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide

boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful said david learmount operations and safety editor at industry magazine flight international but the 777200lr is a niche player mr learmount continued adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft mr learmount pointed out that the 777200lr has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders he also said that while the plane may be able to fly to sydney from london in one hit prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey

for airbus the future is big  it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports from there passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft it has been producing a rival to boeings 777 line for more than a year airbus is now where boeing was a few years ago with its product range said flight internationals mr learmount

both boeing and airbus have been taking orders for their new planes boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777200lr planes over the next 20 years it already has orders from pakistan international airlines and eva of taiwan these orders should help underpin the companys profits boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner the 717 and the cancellation of a us air force 767 tanker contract net profit was 186m 98m; 143m euros in the quarter compared with 113bn in the same period in 2003
