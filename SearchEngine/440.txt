us trade deficit widens sharply

the gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than 60bn 317bn an alltime record

figures from the commerce department for november showed exports down 23% to 956bn while imports grew 13% to 1558bn on rising consumer demand part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports but the numbers suggested the sliding dollar  which makes exports less expensive  has had little impact and could indicate slowing economic growth

the trade deficit  far bigger than the 54bn widely expected on wall street  prompted a rapid response from the currency markets

by 1650 gmt the dollar was trading against the euro at 13280 almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement against the pound the dollar was down about 07% at 18923 the dollars fall has been sudden violent and appropriate given this number said brian taylor of wells fargo in minneapolis recent exchange rate movements certainly havent had any impact yet treasury secretary john snow put a brave face on the news saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion the economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners

although the white house officially still backs the uss traditional strong dollar policy it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued the dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro  as well as by 30% against the yen  in the past three years the main catalyst most economists accept is the large budget deficit on the one hand and the current account deficit  the difference between the flow of money in and out of the us  on the other the trade deficit is a large part of the latter in november the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals as well as of cars consumer goods and food one small bright spot for us policymakers was a slight decline in the deficit with china often blamed for job losses and other economic woes although chinas overall trade surplus is expanding according to chinese government figures the commerce department revealed the uss deficit with china was 196bn in november down from 197bn the month before but the deficit with japan was at its worst in more than four years
