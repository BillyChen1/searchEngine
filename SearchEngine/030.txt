soaring oil hits world economy

the soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth although worlds major economies should weather the storm of price rises according to the oecd

in its latest biannual report the oecd cut its growth predictions for the worlds main industrialised regions us growth would reach 44% in 2004 but fall to 33% next year from a previous estimate of 37% the oecd said however the parisbased economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum

forecasts for japanese growth were also scaled back to 40% from 44% this year and 21% from 28% in 2005 but the outlook was worst for the 12member eurozone bloc with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 18% from 20% this year and 19% from 24% in 2005 the oecd said overall the report forecast total growth of 36% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the oecd slipping to 29% next year before recovering to 31% in 2006 there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a nottoodistant future said jeanphilippe cotis the oecds chief economist the price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004 but down on the record high of 5567 set in late october

a dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending the oecd said the oil shock is not enormous by historical standards  we have seen worse in the seventies if the oil price does not rise any further then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters vincent koen a senior economist with the oecd told the bbcs world business report the recovery that was underway and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year would then regain momentum in the course of 2005 chinas booming economy and a spectacular comeback in japan  albeit one that has faltered in recent months  would help world economic recovery the oecd said supported by strong balance sheets and high profits the recovery of business investment should continue in north america and start in earnest in europe it added however the report warned: it remains to be seen whether continental europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand the oecd highlighted current depressed household expenditure in germany and the eurozones overreliance on exportled growth
