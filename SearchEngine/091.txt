russia gets investment blessing

soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean russian debt is no longer a risky investment one of the worlds leading credit rating agencies says

standard & poors has classed russian bonds as investment grade up from their former speculative rating russias reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant yukos s&p said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk russia is now a net creditor rather than a debtor gold and foreign currency reserves of 119bn beat its foreign public debt of some 113bn

the other two major ratings agencies  fitch and moodys have long since upped their rating of russias sovereign debt s&p had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms now though it has finally followed suit but the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past instead with russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales s&p said the governments own debt is looking a good bet these improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on russia wrote s&p credit analyst helena hessel

the yukos saga is the most highprofile of the political risks to which ms hessel alludes the companys founder and exchief executive mikhail khodorkovsky is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud many believe the real motive for his prosecution is that he threatened to use his wealth to set up a political alternative to president vladimir putin his company meanwhile is widely believed to have fallen victim to the kremlins wish to get russian energy resources as far as possible back under state control
