gm in crunch talks on fiat future

fiat will meet car giant general motors gm on tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the italian firms lossmaking auto group

fiat claims that gm is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; gm says the contract signed in 2000 is no longer valid press reports have speculated that fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand

the meeting between fiat boss sergio marchionne and gms rick wagoner is due to take place at 1330 gmt in zurich according to the reuters news agency

mr marchionne is confident of his firms legal position saying in an interview with the financial times that gms argument has no legs the agreement in question dates back to gms decision to buy 20% of fiats auto division in 2000 at the time it gave the italian firm the right via a put option to sell the remaining stake to gm in recent weeks fiat has reiterated its claims that this put is still valid and legally binding however gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year which cut gms holding to 10% together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement

selling the fiats carmaking unit may not prove so simple analysts say especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to italys industrial heritage political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise we are not expecting fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling gm at this point brokerage merrill lynch said in a note to investors adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business as far as we are aware the agnelli family which indirectly controls at least 30% of fiat has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business fiat may be willing to cancel the put in exchange for money
