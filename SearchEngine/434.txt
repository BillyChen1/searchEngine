asia quake increases poverty risk

nearly two million people across asia could be thrown into poverty because of the indian ocean tsunami the asian development bank adb has said

in its first overview of the disaster the adb said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage but the blow to many lowincome people could be enormous the paris club of rich creditor nations on wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunamihit countries

the move was aimed at helping south asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas though so far only sri lanka indonesia and the seychelles have indicated that they will take it up

other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster said adb chief economist ifzal ali donor nations have promised to give 717m 379m in disaster relief over the next six months according to the united nations

mr ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on concerns over sanitation and health conditions and other basic needs being properly and quickly addressed

there are 19 billion people in asia living on less than 2 a day the adb fears that 1 million indonesians could join them while in india just over half a million people  645000  are at risk of falling into poverty a quarter of a million sri lankans and 23500 people in the maldives are also facing poverty in the maldives where 43% of the population already lives on less than 2 a day this could rise to half sri lanka and the maldives are the two countries the adb fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami sri lankas government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly 3bn a government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the adb world bank and japanese aid agencies on wednesday and promised to publish the plan within 10 days

indonesia malaysia thailand and india have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years which should cushion them against reconstruction costs although indonesias northern province of aceh suffered the worst death toll the regions oil and natural gas production facilities have survived intact the report said however it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor peoples livelihoods in aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater this is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering but the economies of the affected countries except sri lanka and the maldives should emerge with minimal damage the adb report said some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts thereby creating jobs at a meeting in thailand abd president thadao chino said he was confident of the countrys own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze while india has also rejected international aid saying it can cope on its own resources debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades making it more expensive to borrow money in future indonesia however is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring it is one of the worlds most indebted countries
