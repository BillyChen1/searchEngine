uk house prices dip in november

uk house prices dipped slightly in november the office of the deputy prime minister odpm has said

the average house price fell marginally to 180226 from 180444 in october recent evidence has suggested that the uk housing market is slowing after interest rate increases and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005 but while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market annual house price inflation is still strong up 138% in the year to november economists however forecast that odpm figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months overall the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data said mark miller at hbos treasury services the odpm data is a fairly lagging indicator

the figures come after the bank of england said the number of mortgages approved in the uk has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade the halifax meanwhile said last week that house prices increased by 11% in december  the first monthly rise since september

the uks biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 151% over the whole of 2004 but by only 28% in the second half of the year it is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years the odpm attributed the monthly fall of prices in november to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats it said annual inflation rose between october and november because prices had fallen by 11% in the same period in 2003

the odpm data showed the average house price was 192713 in england; 139544 in wales; 116542 in scotland and 111314 in northern ireland

all areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in november except for northern ireland and the west midlands where the rate was unchanged the odpm said the north east showed the highest rate of inflation at 262% followed by yorkshire and the humber on 217% and the north west on 211% the east midlands the west midlands and the south west all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15% in london the area with the highest average house price at 262825 annual inflation rose only slightly in november to 71% from 7% the previous month
