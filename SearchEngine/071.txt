japan turns to beer alternatives

japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beerflavoured drinks rather than beer itself

beer and spirits are heavily taxed in japan driving breweries to search for alternatives japans long economic downturn helped drive the trend as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows now according to asahi breweries the market for socalled beerlike drinks is set to grow 84% this year

asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt the chosen name shinnama or new draft disguises its nonbeer nature but despite a record profit in 2004 of 306bn yen 291m; 154m up 318% on the previous year asahi is coming late to the market key rival sapporo is already wellestablished with the beerflavoured draft one suntory meanwhile is doing well with super blue which combines happoshu  an existing lowcost beer alternative made with malt and seawater  and shochu a distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost kirin the fourth big name is launching its own thirdtype drink in april
