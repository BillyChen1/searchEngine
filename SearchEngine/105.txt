budget aston takes on porsche

british car maker aston martin has gone headtohead with porsches 911 sports cars with the launch of its cheapest model yet

with a price tag under 80000 the v8 vantage is tens of thousands of pounds cheaper than existing aston models the vantage is the most important car in the history of our company said astons chief executive ulrich bez aston  whose cars were famously used by james bond  will unveil the vantage at the geneva motor show on thursday mr bez  himself a former executive at rival porsche  said the new car was the companys most affordable car ever and makes the brand accessible this in turn would make aston martin globally visible but still very very exclusive he added

first shown as a concept car at the 2003 north american international auto show in detroit the v8 vantage will be available in the uk in late summer development costs for the vantage have been kept low by sharing a platform with astons db9 which mr bez described as the previous most important car for our company there is currently an 18 months waiting list for the db9 mr bez said the vantage will be built at the new aston factory in gaydon near warwick and should more than double astons total output from about 2000 presently
