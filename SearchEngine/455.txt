qantas considers offshore option

australian airline qantas could transfer as many as 7000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs according to newspaper reports

chief executive geoff dixon was quoted by the australian newspaper as saying the carrier could no longer afford to remain allaustralian unions criticised the possible move  which may affect cabin and maintenance staff  saying qantas was profitable more than 90% of the airlines staff are based in australia

qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas  potentially through joint ventures  but said it would continue to create jobs in australia

despite making a record australian dollars 648m 492m profit last year qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive were going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas the newspaper quoted qantas chief executive geoff dixon as saying early this year qantas increased the number of flight attendants based in london from 370 to 870 if qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff offshore 7000 jobs could shift overseas the newspaper reported in a statement qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas however it stressed this would not result in large scale redundancies in its home market where most of its 35000 staff are employed we are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in australia mr dixon said we are however operating in a global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful

unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure arguing that qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action we could understand if qantas was a struggling airline about to go under michael mijatov international division secretary of the flight attendants association told agence france presse qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary in an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers qantas sought a tieup with air new zealand last year however the deal was thrown out by the new zealand high court on competition grounds
