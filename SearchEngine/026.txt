safety alert as gm recalls cars

the worlds biggest carmaker general motors gm is recalling nearly 200000 vehicles in the us on safety grounds according to federal regulators

the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa said the largest recall involves 155465 pickups vans and sports utility vehicles suvs this is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems the affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years gm said those vehicles with potential faults are the chevrolet avalanche express kodiak silverade and suburban; the gmc savana sierra and yukon

the nhtsa said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open this could allow hydraulic fluid to leak which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash it warned gm is also recalling 19924 cadillac xlr coupes srx suvs and pontiac grand prix sedans from the 2004 model year this is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures requiring more braking in addition the car giant is calling back 17815 buick raniers chevrolet trailblazers gmc envoys and isuzu ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash however gm stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems news of the recall follows an announcement last month that gm expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004 the worlds biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its european business weak us sales and now a product recall in january gm said higher healthcare costs in north america and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005
