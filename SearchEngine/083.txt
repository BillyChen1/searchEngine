yukos accused of lying to court

russian oil firm yukos lied to a us court in an attempt to stop the russian government selling off its key production unit the court has heard

the unit yugansk was sold to pay off a 275bn 145bn back tax bill yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk but deutsche bank  itself a target of a yukos lawsuit  said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case

deutsche banks evidence came on the first day of a twoday hearing in houston its lawyer hugh ray told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred 27m into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary by doing so he said the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence  and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts but he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 december and then backdated

yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa acknowledged the point he said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 december even so he told the court that only 480000 had been in the accounts that day with the rest arriving a day later

deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos it had agreed to loan to an arm of russian state gas firm gazprom the money to bid for yuganskneftegaz as the yukos unit is formally known the sale went ahead despite an order from the us bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped in the end the auction was won by an unknown shell company for 94bn  much less than most assessments of its value  before ending up in the hands of statecontrolled oil firm rosneft rosneft meanwhile has agreed to merge with gazprom bringing a large chunk of russias very profitable oil business back under state control

yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the us because it feared it would not be able to do so in russia it also said that in the event of going bust it could offer the chance of restructuring it gives us a kind of life after death alternative said yukos chief executive steven theede yukos is currently suing four companies  gazprom its unit gazpromneft rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding  for their part in yugansks disposal it has also threatened to sue the russian government for 28bn analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies while moscow officials have dismissed yukos legal wrangling as meaningless yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky once russias richest man is in prison having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail
