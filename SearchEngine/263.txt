splitcaps pay 194m compensation

investors who lost money following the splitcapital investment trust scandal are to receive 194m compensation the uks financial watchdog has announced

eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the financial services authority fsa splits were marketed as a lowrisk way to benefit from rising share prices but when the stock market collapsed in 2000 the products left thousands of investors out of pocket an estimated 50000 people took out splitcapital funds some investing their life savings in the schemes the paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company the fsa said

further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year this should save investors from having to take their case to the financial ombudsman service something no doubt that will be very welcome rob mcivor fsa spokesman told bbc news agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt the fsa added any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the financial ombudsman service

the fsa has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by splitcapital investment trusts the fsas 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a socalled magic circle in the hope of propping up one anothers share prices

firms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews in may the fsa was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to 350m in compensation mr mcivor told the bbc that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the financial ombudsman service or the courts
