walmart fights back at accusers

two big us names have launched advertising campaigns to set the record straight about their products and corporate behaviour

the worlds biggest retailer walmart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers the group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals benefits package and promotion strategy meanwhile drugs group eli lilly is planning a campaign against false claims about its product prozac walmart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the wall street journal using an open letter from company president lee scott saying it was time for the public to hear the unfiltered truth

there are lots of urban legends going around these days about walmart but facts are facts walmart is good for consumers good for communities and good for the us economy mr scott said in a separate statement

its adverts  and a new website  outlined the groups plans to create more than 10000 us jobs in 2005 walmarts average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of 515 390 an hour while employees are offered health and life insurance company stock and a retirement plan the adverts say unions accuse walmart of paying staff less than its rivals do with fewer benefits in california the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs i think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people said larry bevington chairman of save our community  a group fighting to prevent walmart opening a store in rosemead california walmart is also fighting two lawsuits  one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees

meanwhile eli lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers to present what is says are the true facts about its antidepressant drug prozac

the move is in response to a british medical journal article that claimed missing lilly documents linked prozac to suicide and violent behaviour in the averts entitled an open letter from chief executive sidney taurel the company says the article continues to needlessly spread fear among patients who take prozac it was simply wrong to suggest that information on prozac was missing or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators the letter added eli lillys chief medical officer alan breier said that the article was false and misleading as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the us food and drug administration fda and presented to an fda meeting in 1991 later fda medical advisors agreed the claims were based on faulty data and there was no increased risk of suicide
