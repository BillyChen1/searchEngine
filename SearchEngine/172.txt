newest eu members underpin growth

the european unions newest members will bolster europes economic growth in 2005 according to a new report

the eight central european states which joined the eu last year will see 46% growth the united nations economic commission for europe unece said in contrast the 12 euro zone countries will put in a lacklustre performance generating growth of only 18% the global economy will slow in 2005 the unece forecasts due to widespread weakness in consumer demand

it warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the united states huge current account deficit which in turn might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates

unece is forecasting average economic growth of 22% across the european union in 2005 however total output across the euro zone is forecast to fall in 2004 from 19% to 18% this is due largely to the faltering german economy which shrank 02% in the last quarter of 2004 on monday germanys bdb private banks association said the german economy would struggle to meet its 14% growth target in 2005

separately the bundesbank warned that germanys efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of gdp presented huge risks given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year publishing its 2005 economic survey the unece said central european countries such as the czech republic and slovenia would provide the backbone of the continents growth smaller nations such as cyprus ireland and malta would also be among the continents best performing economies this year it said the uk economy on the other hand is expected to slow in 2005 with growth falling from 32% last year to 25%

consumer demand will remain fragile in many of europes largest countries and economies will be mostly driven by growth in exports in view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to wait and see the organisation said in its report global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 425% despite the continued strength of the chinese and us economies the unece warned that attempts to bring about a controlled reduction in the us current account deficit could cause difficulties the orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the united states and other economies it noted
