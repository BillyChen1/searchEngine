asia shares defy postquake gloom

thailand has become the first of the 10 southern asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast

thailands economy is now expected to grow by 57% in 2005 rather than 6% as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces the full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear in part this is because of its scale and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities but indonesian indian and hong kong stock markets reached record highs on wednesday suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact

the highs showed the gap in outlook between investors in large firms and individuals who have lost their livelihoods

investors seemed to feel that some of the worstaffected areas  such as aceh in indonesia  were so underdeveloped that the tragedy would little impact on asias listed companies according to analysts obviously with a lot of loss of life a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess bury the people and find the missing but its not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense said abn amro chief asian strategist eddie wong indias bombay stock exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on wednesday expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the indonesian stock exchange in jakarta to a record high on wednesday in hong kong the hang seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunamiaffected regions of south east asia in sri lanka some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost sri lankas stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004

thailand may lose 30bn baht 398m; 768m in earnings from tourism over the next three months according to tourism minister sontaya kunplome

in the affected provinces he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending thailand intends to spend a similar sum  around 30bn baht  on the rebuilding work it will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level said naris chaiyasoot director general at the ministrys fiscal policy office in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth according to a government spokesman our nation is in peril here said ahmed shaheed the chief government spokesman he estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars the maldives has gross domestic product of 660m it wont be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp he said in the last few years we made great progress in our standard of living  the united nations recognised this now we see this can disappear in a few days a few minutes shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort  the economic mainstay  could run to 40m between 10 and 12 of the 80odd resorts have been severely damaged and a similar number have suffered significant damage however many experts including the world bank have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact
