jobs growth still slow in the us

the us created fewer jobs than expected in january but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years

according to labor department figures us firms added only 146000 jobs in january the gain in nonfarm payrolls was below market expectations of 190000 new jobs nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 52% its lowest level since september 2001 the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate  albeit by a very fine margin  a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last novembers presidential election  the first president to do so since herbert hoover as a result job creation became a key issue in last years election however when adding december and januarys figures the administrations first term jobs record ended in positive territory

the labor department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in december 2004 from 157000 to 133000

analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions it suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace said rick egelton deputy chief economist at bmo financial group we are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment the economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth said ken mayland president of clearview economics that means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers
