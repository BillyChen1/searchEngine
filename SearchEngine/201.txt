novartis which last month forecast record sales for 2005 said it had bought all of germanys hexal it also acquired 677% of hexals us affiliate eon labs and offered to buy the remaining shares for 31 each novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about 200m a year following the acquisitions novartis shares rose 1% to 5785 swiss francs in early trading

the deal will see novartis sandoz business overtake israels teva pharmaceuticals as the worlds biggest maker of generics based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than 5bn the company estimated novartis said that it would merge a number of departments adding that there may be job cuts

the strong growth outlook for sandoz which will create jobs is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force the firm said in a statement generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals producers such as sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost

there are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented however not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal this is a very expensive acquisition birgit kuhlhoff from sal oppenheim investment bank told reuters i find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure
