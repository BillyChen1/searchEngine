golden economic period to end

ten years of golden economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly city consultancy deloitte has warned

the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year below chancellor gordon browns forecast of 3% to 35% it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year

in its quarterly economic review deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a golden period during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s

but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major imbalances in the economy deloittes chief economic advisor roger bootle said: the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace

economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes deloitte believes gordon brown will need to raise about 10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term the firm claims this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year when the economy expanded by 325% however deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering it expects a series of aggressive interest rate cuts over the next two years with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 475% mark to 35% by the end of 2006 although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy mr bootle
