minister hits out at yukos sale

russias renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed a senior government figure has warned

economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was unjustified his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes  a deal which effectively took most of the firms assets into public ownership on 28 december another senior economic adviser called the sale the swindle of the century yuganskneftegaz the unit which produced 60% of yukos output had been seized and sold in december for less than 10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal

baikal promptly passed into the hands of statecontrolled firm rosneft itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing andrei illarionov  then economic adviser to president vladimir putin  told a press conference now officials are doing it within days he was stripped of most of his responsibilities

mr gref a wellknown opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronovs comments the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled he said but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz should it become a stateowned company must be privatized he said

today our government is ineffective and state companies as a result are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos  a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms  was a mistake if we follow that logic we should nationalise all businesses he said many large russian companies particularly in the energy sector use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes

mr gref also poured cold water on president putins promises of doubled economic growth within a decade the assault on yukos assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve peoples lives mr gref told kommersant we dont need simply to increase gdp but to improve its structure instead of focusing on headline growth figures russia needed to focus on better institutions such as a more efficient  and less corrupt  court system
