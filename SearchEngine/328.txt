bush to get tough on deficit

us president george w bush has pledged to introduce a tough federal budget next february in a bid to halve the countrys deficit in five years

the us budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy mr bush indicated there would be strict discipline on nondefence spending in the budget the vow to cut the deficit had been one of his reelection declarations the federal budget deficit hit a record 412bn 2116bn in the 12 months to 30 september and 377bn in the previous year

we will submit a budget that fits the times mr bush said it will provide every tool and resource to the military will protect the homeland and meet other priorities of the government the us has said it is committed to a strong dollar but the dollars weakness has hit european and asian exporters and lead to calls for us intervention to boost the currency mr bush however has said the best way to halt the dollars slide is to deal with the us deficit its a budget that i think will send the right signal to the financial markets and to those concerned about our shortterm deficits mr bush added as well weve got to deal with the longterm deficit issues
