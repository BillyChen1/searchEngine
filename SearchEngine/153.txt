house prices show slight increase

prices of homes in the uk rose a seasonally adjusted 05% in february says the nationwide building society

the figure means the annual rate of increase in the uk is down to 102% the lowest rate since june 2001 the annual rate has halved since august last year as interest rises have cooled the housing market at the same time the number of mortgage approvals fell in january to a near 10year low official bank of england figures have shown

nationwide said that in january house prices went up by 04% on the month and by 126% on a year earlier we are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared said nationwide economist alex bannister there have been a number of warnings that the uk housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004 in november barclays which owns former building society the woolwich forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005 followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007 and last summer economists at pricewaterhousecoopers pwc warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009

the price of an average uk property now stands at 152879 homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months mr bannister said he said if the growth continued at this level then the bank of england may increase interest rates from their current 475%

i think the key is what the bank expects to happen to the housing market we always thought we would see a small rise they thought they would see a small decline house prices have risen 09% this year nationwide said and if this pace of increase persists prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to december this is slightly above the 05% range nationwide predicts

further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from bank of england lending figures released on tuesday new mortgage loans in january fell to 79000 from 82000 in december the bank said the past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995 the bank revealed that 48000 fewer mortgages were approved in january than for the same month in 2004 overall mortgage lending rose by 72bn in january marginally up on the 71bn rise in december
