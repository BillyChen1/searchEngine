strong dollar call halts slide

the us dollars slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was in americas interest

but analysts said any gains are likely to be shortlived as problems with the us economy were still significant they also pointed out that positive comments apart president george w bushs administration had done little to stop the dollars slide a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit the dollar was trading at 12944 against the euro at 2100gmt still close to the 13006 record level set on 10 november against the japanese yen it was trading at 10528 yen after hitting a sevenmonth low of 10517 earlier in the day

policy makers in europe have called the dollars slide brutal and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth however it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euros rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit  that has been weighing on the dollar  could be reduced mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a fournation eu visit has applauded irelands introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth the eurozone is growing below its potential when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences for the citizens of those economies and for their trading partners he said mr snows comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday but he was careful to qualify his statement

our basic policy of course is to let open competitive markets set the values he explained markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals us officials have also said that other economies need to grow so the us is not the main global growth engine economists say that the fundamentals or key indicators of the us economy are looking far from rosy domestic consumer demand is cooling and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record 427bn 230bn the current account deficit meanwhile hit a record 166bn in the second quarter of 2004 for many analysts a weaker dollar is here to stay no end is in sight said carsten fritsch a strategist at commerzbank  it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches 130 some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe thus boosting its economy
