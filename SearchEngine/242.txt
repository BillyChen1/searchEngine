q&a: malcolm glazer and man utd

the battle for control of manchester united has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from us business tycoon malcolm glazer

no formal offer has been made yet but manchester united have confirmed they have received a detailed proposal from the us entrepreneur which could lead to a bid reports have put the offer at 300p per share which would value manchester united at about 800m 15bn the approach by the 76yearold owner of the tampa bay buccaneers american football team is reportedly being led by his two sons avi and joel a previous approach to the united board by mr glazer in october last year was turned down however the bbc has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand

mr glazers previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover that would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed not in the best interests of the company by manchester uniteds board when they rejected his approach last year however mr glazers latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by 200m

while uniteds board may be casting a serious eye over mr glazers latest proposals supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal

supporters group shareholders united  which has proved adept in rallying opposition to mr glazers campaign  said it would fight any move manchester united are a debtfree company we dont want to fall into debt and we dont need to fall into debt shareholders uniteds sean bones told the bbc uniteds players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover a lot of people want the clubs interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart rio ferdinand told bbc radio five live noone knows what this guy will be bringing to the table

the key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of uniteds largest shareholders the irish horse racing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus through their cubic expression vehicle they own 289% of the club mr glazer owns 281% joe mclean a football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was utterly crucial mr glazers bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment if thats the case the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence maybe 305 if thats the case then mr glazer might well secure their support  if he does this bid could well go ahead

indeed it is malcolm glazer was littleknown in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late 2003 in february 2004 he said he was considering whether to bid for the club no bid emerged but mr glazer continued to increase his holding in the club in october 2004 manchester united said they had received a preliminary approach which turned out to have come from mr glazer however the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve at the clubs annual general meeting in november mr glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board legal adviser maurice watkins commercial director andy anson and nonexecutive director philip yea were voted out against the wishes of chief executive david gill but the move led to bankers jp morgan and public relations firm brunswick withdrawing from the glazer bid team
