arsenal may seek full share listing

arsenal vicechairman david dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the london stock exchange

speaking at the soccerex football business forum in dubai he said a full listing was one of the options for funding after the club moves to its new stadium the club  which is currently listed on the smaller ofex share exchange  is due to move into its new 60000seater emirates stadium at ashburton grove for the start of the 200607 season mr dein also warned the current level of tv coverage of the premiership may be reaching saturation level with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season

when arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years time the club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover and has not ruled out other moneyearning means including a full share listing when the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review mr dein said

listing would be one option but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet we want to be in the best financial health  maybe clubs can do it listing manchester united have been a success

mr dein said that although television money and coverage had driven the english game forward in the past 10 years he feared there might now be too many games being shown since the formation of the premier league in season 199293 premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar television has been the driving force over the past 10 years but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the worlds leading league competition we must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on tv too i think we have practically reached saturation point sometimes i think less is more

the club is funding its move to ashburton grove through a number of sources including debt from banks from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors and from the sale of surplus property including its highbury stadium it is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets including asia we have two executives travelling round japan and china at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too as they are around the world we have got a very good product so it is very important we go and look at these markets and make sure we are on the case
