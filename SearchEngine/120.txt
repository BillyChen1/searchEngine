nigeria to boost cocoa production

the government of nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme

agriculture minister adamu bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180000 tonnes this year to 600000 tonnes by 2008 the government will pump 154m naira 11m; 591000 into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings nigeria is currently the worlds fourthlargest cocoa producer

cocoa was the main export product in nigeria during the 1960s but with the coming of oil the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400000 tonnes a year in 1970 at the launch of the programme in the southwestern city of ibadan mr bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption he also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries the country could be looking to emulate rival ghana which produced a bumper crop last year however some farmers are sceptical about the proposals people who are not farming will hijack the subsidy said joshua osagie a cocoa farmer from edo state told reuters the farmers in the village never see any assistance he added

at the same time as nigeria announced its new initiative ghana  the worlds second largest cocoa exporter  announced revenues from the industry had broken new records the country saw more than 12bnworth of the beans exported during 200304 analysts said high techproduction techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the worlds leading cocoa grower
