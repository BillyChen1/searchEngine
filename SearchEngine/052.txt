italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the countrys sputtering economy on thursday night in rome

he will present an action plan for the development of italy in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders mr berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development r&d spending and the competitiveness of small firms also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system the prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 gmt

the government has been accused of underfunding r&d making it harder for italy to compete with other european nations and leading to a braindrain of the countrys brightest talents analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive hampering the development of small and mediumsized businesses as a result they say italys corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm at the same time bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts a situation that is hampering italys entrepreneurial spirit

the government says that it has set about tackling the problems adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of italys 60 million population according to il sole 24 ore italys business newspaper the government will focus on opening up markets infrastructure research making more incentives available bankruptcy law the slow pace of the justice system

mr berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 65bn euros 86bn; 45bn this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend he has also promised to cap spending on transport education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005 including a partial flotation of the post office and utility enel critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make italys problems worse limiting government spending will lead to job losses they counter while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy

the country has been one of the eurozones worst economic performers in recent years growth was 11% in 2004 up from just 03% in 2003 and 04% in 2002  an improvement but still a long way from ideal at the same time business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards without a pick up in national growth they say the money could eventually run out bringing italys economy to a juddering halt consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of italys economy
