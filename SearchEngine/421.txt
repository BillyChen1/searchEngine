lse sets date for takeover deal

the london stock exchange lse is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month newspaper reports claim

the sunday telegraph said the lses plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny both deutsche boerse and rival euronext held talks with the london market last week over a possible offer a 13bn offer from deutsche boerse has already been rejected while euronext has said it will make an all cash bid speculation suggests that parisbased euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of 14bn while its german rival may up its bid to the 15bn mark neither has yet tabled a formal bid but the lse is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week however the sunday telegraph report added that there are signs that deutsche boerse chief executive werner seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the lses managed bid process

despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the lses board the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead the newspaper also claimed mr seifert was becoming increasingly frustrated with the pace of negotiations since deutsche boerses 13bn offer was rejected in middecember in particular the lses decision to suspend talks over the christmas period meanwhile the german exchanges offer has come under fire recently unions for deutsche boerse staff in frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to london if the takeover is successful others claim it will weaken the citys status as europes financial centre while german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operators promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid is successful a further stumbling block is deutsche boerses control over its clearstream unit the clearing house that processes securities transactions lse shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings lse and euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive
