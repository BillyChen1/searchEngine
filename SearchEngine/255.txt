call to overhaul uk state pension

the uk pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement thinktank

the pensions policy institute ppi said replacing the state pension with a citizens pension would help tackle inequality and complexity the change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the uk rather than national insurance ni contributions reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records

the ppi added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions the think tanks proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the pensions commissions initial report into uk retirement savings according to the pensions commissions report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement as a result living standards could fall for the next generation of uk pensioners the report added that a combination of higher taxes higher savings andor a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the uk pension crisis
