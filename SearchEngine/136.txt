ukraine revisits state selloffs

ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration

the new president viktor yushchenko has said a limited list of companies is being drawn up but on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3000 firms the government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rockbottom prices more than 90000 businesses in all from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts have been sold off since 1992 as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled

ms tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3000 businesses which were to be reviewed we will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands

a day earlier mr yushchenko  keen to reassure potential investors  had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted the list will be limited and final and will not be extended after its completion he said an openended list could further damage outside investors fragile faith in ukraine said stuart hensel of the economist intelligence unit but the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in russia mr hensel said as a result it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands theyre aware of the need not to scare investors and to be careful of internal divides within ukraine he said they dont want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set foreign investment in ukraine at about 40 a head in 2004 is one of the lowest among exsoviet states

mr yushchenko became president after two elections in december the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests

his opponent viktor yanukovich still has huge support in the countrys eastern industrial heartland mr yushchenkos administration has accused its predecessor led by expresident leonid kuchma of corruption the privatisation reviews number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included viktor pinchuk mr kuchmas soninlaw for 800m 424m despite higher bids from several foreign groups the mill krivorizhstal is one of the worlds most profitable we say krivorizhstal was stolen and at any cost we will return it to the state mr yushchenko told an investors conference in kiev

one of the jilted bidders netherlandsbased group lnm said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market

if the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued then we would look at it with great interest a spokesman told bbc news a resale of krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price according to the economist intelligence units mr hensel but he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale that way mr yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules he told bbc news
