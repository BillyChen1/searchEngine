australia rates at four year high

australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the countrys economy

the reserve bank of australia lifted interest rates 025% to 55% their first upwards move in more than a year however shortly after the bank made its decision new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter the bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts

the rate hike was the first since december 2003 and had been wellflagged in advance however opposition parties and some analysts said the move was illtimed given data showing the australian economy grew just 01% between october and december and 15% on an annual basis

the figures representing a decline from the 02% growth in gdp seen between july and september were below market expectations consumer spending remains strong however and the bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited said ian macfarlane governor of the reserve bank

at 26% inflation remains within the banks 23% target range however exports declined in the second half of 2004 fuelling a rise in the countrys current account deficit  the difference in the value of imports compared to exports  to a record australian dollar 294bn the australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low the economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesnt look to me like its slowing in any unreasonable way said treasurer peter costello stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy that 15% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the postelection slump we saw back in 20001 said michael blythe chief economist at the commonwealth bank of australia this suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004
