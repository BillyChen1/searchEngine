five million germans out of work

germanys unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month

on wednesday the german federal labour agency said the jobless total had reached 5037 million in january which takes the jobless rate to 121% yes we have effectively more than five million people unemployed a government minister said earlier on zdf public television unemployment has not been this high in germany since the 1930s

changes to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of 572900 in the numbers but the figures are embarrassing for the government with the figures apparently the worst weve seen in the postwar period these numbers are very charged politically said christian jasperneite an economist with mm warburg they could well put an end to the recent renaissance weve seen by the spd the ruling social democrats in the polls and with state elections due in schleswigholstein and north rhinewestphalia they may have an adverse effect on the governments chances there

the opposition also made political capital from the figures it said there are a further 15 million2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are in fact looking for real jobs it added that government reforms including unpopular benefit cuts do not go far enough under the governments controversial hartz iv reforms which came into effect at the beginning of the year both those on unemployment benefits and welfare support and those who are longterm unemployed are officially classified as looking for work the bad winter weather also took its toll as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers adjusted for the seasonal factors the german jobless total rose by 227000 in january from december
