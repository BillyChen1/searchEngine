putin backs state grab for yukos

russias president has defended the purchase of yukos key production unit by stateowned oil firm rosneft saying it followed free market principles

vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a stateowned company to ensure its interests were met rosneft bought 100% of baikal finance group in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of russias booming oil industry rosneft will now control about 16% of russias total crude oil output yukos share jumped in moscow climbing as much as 50% before being suspended

rosneft is already in the process of merging with gazprom the worlds biggest gas company a move that will see gazprom return to majority stateownership

baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukoss main production division at a forced auction on sunday everything was done by market methods mr putin said at his yearend press conference in moscow shedding some light on the kremlins motivation mr putin referred to a period of socalled cowboy capitalism that followed the collapse of the soviet union

he said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery including law breaking by people seeking to acquire valuable state property now the state using market methods is safeguarding its interests i think this is quite normal the russian president said a rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a balanced national energy corporation

the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos one of russias biggest companies to the brink of collapse the russian government put yukoss yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a 27bn 14bn bill for back taxes and fines

analysts say that yukoss legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this weeks cloakanddagger dealings gazprom the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction by selling the yukos unit to littleknown baikal and then to rosneft russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines analysts said you cannot sue the russian government said eric kraus a strategist at moscows sovlink securities the russian government has sovereign immunity the government is renationalising yuganskneftegas

even so analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sundays auction it has said it will be seeking damages of 20bn the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston texas where yukos had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if found in contempt of the us court order blocking the auction gazprom could face having foreign assets seized yukos lawyers had also been expected to try to have baikals assets frozen lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos  with an office in houston  had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned
