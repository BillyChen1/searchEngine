brazil plays down varig rescue

the brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the countrys biggest airline

brazils airport authority chief carlos wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save varig brazils flagship airline however the countrys vice president jose alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 65 billion reais 23bn or 12bn asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the countrys congress to discuss the airlines crisis mr alencar replied: no i dont think so we will see

earlier mr wilson had said that president luiz inacio lula da silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week in practice it will be an intervention although this is not the technical name used he said an intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances for that to happen varigs main shareholder the nonprofit ruben berta foundation which represents the airlines employees would have to be removed mr wilson said however no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying he added varig which operates in 18 countries apart from brazil has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the countrys economic downturn

the depreciation of brazils currency has had a direct impact on the airlines dollar debt as well as some of its costs business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the brazilian economy the airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government on tuesday the courts awarded varig 2bn reais 725m after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992 but the government can appeal the decision
