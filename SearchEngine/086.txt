manufacturing recovery slowing

uk manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in oneandahalf years in january according to a survey

the chartered institute of purchasing and supply cips said its purchasing manager index pmi fell to 518 from a revised 533 in december but despite missing forecasts of 537 the pmi number remained above 50  indicating expansion in the sector the cips said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high

the survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs that triggered the second successive monthly fall in the cips employment index to 483  its lowest level since june 2003 the survey is more upbeat than official figures  which suggest that manufacturing is in recession  but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam it appears that the uk is in a twotier economy again said prebon yamane economist lena komileva you have weakness in manufacturing which i think would concern policymakers at the bank of england
