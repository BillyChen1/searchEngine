verizon seals takeover of mci

verizon has won a takeover battle for us phone firm mci with a bid worth 68bn 36bn reports say

the two firms are expected to seal the deal on monday morning according to news agency reports despite what was thought to be a higher bid from qwest the us telecoms market is consolidating fast with former longdistance giant at&t being bought by former subsidiary sbc earlier this year for 16bn mci exited bankruptcy in april having gone bust under previous name worldcom the bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits

shareholders lost about 180bn when the company collapsed while 20000 workers lost their jobs former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial accused of overseeing an 11bn fraud qwest has itself come under suspicion of substandard behaviour paying the securities and exchange commission 250m in october to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep wall street happy

mci is the uss secondbiggest long distance firm after at&t consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billiondollar telecoms deal since october last week sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about 16bn buying mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mcis global network and businessbased subscribers the rationale is similar to the one underpinning sbcs at&t deal verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm  factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares
