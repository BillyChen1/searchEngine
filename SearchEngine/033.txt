rich grab half colombia poor fund

half of the money put aside by the colombian government to help the countrys poor is benefiting people who do not need it a study has found

a total of 242 trillion pesos 102bn; 55bn is earmarked for subsidies for the poor the government department for planning said but it also found 121 trillion pesos was going to the richest part of the population rather than to those in need sound distribution of the cash could cut poverty levels to 36% from 53% the government believes resources are more than enough to reduce poverty and there is no need for more tax reforms but a better distribution deputy planning director jose leibovich said

colombia has a population of about 44 million and half lives below poverty line however some large properties are paying less in tax as they are situated inside poor areas which benefit from cheaper utilities such as electricity and water government research found government expenditure in areas such as pensions public services education property and health should be revised mr leibovich said he added that the government is now examining the report but warned there would be no easy solution to the problem with a good distribution of such subsidies and economic growth of just 2% by 2019 poverty could fall as low as 153% he said
