further rise in uk jobless total

the uks jobless total rose for the second month in a row in december official figures show

the number of people out of work rose 32000 to 141 million in the last three months of 2004 even as 90000 more people were in employment average earnings rose by 43% in the year to december up from novembers 42% the office for national statistics ons added meanwhile the benefit claimant total fell 11000 to 813200 last month throughout 2004 the number of people in work increased by 296000 to 2852 million  the highest figure since records began in 1971
