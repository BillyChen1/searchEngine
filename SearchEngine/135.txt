feta cheese battle reaches court

a row over whether only greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the european court of justice

the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name the commissions decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne but critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term with the cheese produced widely outside greece

the commissions controversial 2002 ruling gave protected designation of origin status to feta cheese made in greece effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there

from 2007 onwards greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years in our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese hans arne kristiansen a spokesman for the danish dairy board told the bbc denmark is europes second largest producer of feta after greece  producing about 30000 tonnes a year  and exports its products to greece it is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in denmark such as brie it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation mr kristiansen said that is just one of the costs

the case will also have a major impact on britains sole feta producer yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses

judy bell the companys founder said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product if we lose we will have to go through a massive remerchandising process and reorganisation she said we have never tried to pull the wool over anyones eyes  its very clear from the label that its yorkshire feta the original decision was a victory for greece where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6000 years feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goats milk and is an essential ingredient in greek cuisine greece makes 115000 tonnes mainly for domestic consumption the court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn
