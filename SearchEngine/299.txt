us to rule on yukos refuge call

yukos has said a us bankruptcy court will decide whether to block russias impending auction of its main production arm on thursday

the russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us in an attempt to halt the forced sale however judge letitia clark said the hearing would continue on thursday when arguments in the case would be heard russian authorities are due to auction off yuganskneftegas on 19 december to pay a huge tax bill sent to yukos

russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firms most lucrative asset yuganskneftegas to help pay a 27bn 14bn back tax bill which they claim is owed by yukos

filing for bankruptcy protection in the us was a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders employees and customers said yukos chief executive steven theede the company added it had opted to take action through american courts as us bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor companys property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders investments however as the firm is based in russia and has no significant us assets lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case we are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on sunday zack clement a lawyer for yukos told judge clark in an emergency hearing in houston texas on wednesday as well as the bid to get chapter 11 bankruptcy  which protects firms from creditors allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances  the group also made a claim for damages against the russian government yukos asked the houston court to order russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a campaign of illegal discriminatory and disproportionate tax claims mr clement said that under russian law the russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law

he added that the opening bid for the firms yuganskneftgas unit was 8bn  less than half of the 20bn that yukos advisers say it is worth we believe the only significant bidder at the auction on sunday is gazprom he said referring to russias natural gas giant yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm many commentators believe the russian governments aggressive pursuit of yukos is a politicallymotivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky who had funded liberal opposition groups was arrested in october last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off it is likely to be bought up by a governmentbacked firm like gazprom effectively bringing a large chunk of russias lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control
