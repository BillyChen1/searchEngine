india unveils antipoverty budget

india is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen

indias defence budget has also been raised 78% to 830bn rupees 19bn the priority for finance minister palaniappan chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the governments communist allies onside but his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit which he said would be 45% of gdp in the year to march 2005 the countrys overall deficit is thought to be more than 10% if the spending of indias 35 states and territories is included under the fiscal responsibility law mr chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 03 percentage points each year a target he says he has now met for the current year

but the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 20056 target for the deficit will be 43% mr chidambaram said  falling short of the new laws requirement i was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act he said the following year though would have to be back on track he warned

i may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means he said the coming years reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in indias burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget

presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament mr chidambaram said the indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in he said indias economy grew 69% in 2004 in his budget mr chidambaram has:

 increased spending on primary education to 7156bn rupees 16bn 
  increased spending on health to 1028bn rupees 235bn 
  announced that 80bn rupees 18bn will be spent on building rural infrastructure 
  pledged 10216bn rupees 23bn for tsunami victims 
  increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30% 
  announced a package for the sugar industry

in addition up to 100bn rupees 23bn to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the countrys foreign exchange reserves keeping budgeted spending under control given the resilience of the indian economy it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty mr chidambaram said the whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty the new indian government led by the congress party was voted into power last may after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a human face

the finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming indias tax system while expanding the tax base as part of his reforms he has announced:

 duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials 
  expanded service tax net 
  raised the incometax threshold to 100000 rupees 2300 
  reduced income tax for those earning less than 250000 rupees 5700 to 20% 
  reduced corporate tax rates to 30%

an annual economic survey released on friday said india needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for longterm economic growth but mr chidambaram is under pressure from the communist parties to focus on increasing social spending the communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will in recent months they have expressed their displeasure at the governments economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation in his last budget mr chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers
