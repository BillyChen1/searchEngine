businesses fail to plan for hiv

companies fail to draw up plans to cope with hivaids until it affects 20% of people in a country new research says

the finding comes in a report published on thursday by the world economic forum harvard and the un aids agency too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats said dr kate taylor head of the wefs global health initiative nearly 9000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for business and hivaids: commitment and action

dr taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as too little too late the issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the world economic forum which meets in davos switzerland next week the wef report shows that despite the fact that 14000 people contract hivaids every day concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months most 71% have no policies in place to address the disease nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of hiv among their staff the un programme tackling aids unaids pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with hivaids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible

one company that does have a plan is angloamerican the international mining company which estimates an hiv prevalence of 24% among its 130000strong southern african workforce

over the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for hiv infection coupled with antiretroviral therapy for employees progressing to aids over 90% of the 2200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work effective action on hivaids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations said brian brink senior vicepresident health at angloamerican

companies should encourage all workers to know their hiv status making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol he said providing access to treatment is a critical part of this across subsaharan africa even in countries with an hiv prevalence of 1019% only around 7% of companies have formal hivaids policies in place according to the report the gap is even wider in china ethiopia india nigeria and russia the socalled next wave countries which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new hivaids cases worldwide by 2010 the report adds an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the hivaids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting said david bloom professor of economics and demography at the harvard school of public health

the wef report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to hivaids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them a key priority in both high and lowprevalence settings said the wef is to establish a policy based on nondiscrimination and confidentiality
