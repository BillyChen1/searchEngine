car giant hit by mercedes slump

a slump in profitability at luxury car maker mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent daimlerchrysler

the germanus carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros 1bn from 24bn euros in 2003 mercedesbenzs woes  its profits slid to just 20m euros  obscured a strong performance from the chrysler group whose returns met market expectations mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from bmw and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006

mercedes profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros for the year as a whole its operating profits fell 46% to 16bn euros sales of mercedes brands fell 2% as demand cooled while revenues were affected by the weakness of the us dollar

the carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its mercedes smart minicar range mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with german workers last year the firm said it was determined to retain mercedes position as the worlds most successful luxury brand however daimlerchryslers shares fell 15% on the news while all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround mercedesbenz michael rabb an analyst with bank sal oppenheim told reuters

in contrast chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues  calculated in us dollars  rose 10% the us division  whose marques include dodge and jeep  transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 14bn euros profit last year

overall daimlerchrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 47 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros chryslers strong performance helped the worlds fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 25bn euros

the year 2004 shows that our strategy works well  even in such a challenging competitive environment said jurgen schrempp daimlerchryslers chairman daimlerchrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture japanese subsidiary fuso daimlerchrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner mitsubishi motors which will see it buy out its stake in fuso looking forward daimerchryslers profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005 however it is expecting significant improvements in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the mercedes product range
