now gw pharmas sativex mouth spray could be legally available to ms sufferers in canada within the next few months this will be the first time a cannabisbased drug has been approved anywhere in the world representing a landmark for gw pharma and for patients with ms final approval in canada should now be little more than a formality analysts said and the company expects full approval for sativex early in 2005 we are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from health canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for sativex in canada in the early part of 2005 said gw pharma executive chairman dr geoffrey guy
