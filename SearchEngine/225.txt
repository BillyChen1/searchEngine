in the threemonths to january likeforlike sales showed a growth rate of 01% the same as in the three months to december the brc said following a relatively strong new years bank holiday trading then took a downward turn said mr hawkins even extending some promotions and discounts and the payday boost later in the month could not tempt customers the previous brc survey found christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years for retailers and according to office for national statistics data sales in december failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981
