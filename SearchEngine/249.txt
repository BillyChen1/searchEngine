bush budget seeks deep cutbacks

president bush has presented his 2006 budget cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at 427bn 230bn this year

the 258 trillion 138 trillion budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment education and health but foreign aid is due to rise by 10% with more money to treat hivaids and reward economic and political reform military spending is also set to rise by 48% to reach 4193bn the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan for which the administration is expected to seek an extra 80bn from congress later this year

congress will spend several months debating george w bushs proposal

the state departments planned budget would rise to just under 23bn  a fraction of the defence departments request  including almost 6bn to assist us allies in the war on terror however the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hivaids the bbcs jonathan beale reports and planned spending would almost double to 3bn with much of that money going to african nations mr bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his millennium challenge corporation the scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the us considers to be good governance and sound policies yet mr bushs proposed spending of 3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of 5bn

a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administrations proposed radical overhaul of social security the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income

some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to 45 trillion over a 20year period neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the us emergency petroleum stockpile concern over the level of the reserve created in 1970s has led to rises in oil prices over the past year the bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil  rather than cash  from energy companies that drill under federal leases

the outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 96% at agriculture and 56% at the environmental protection agency the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 61% to 218 trillion spending is forecast to grow by 35% to 257 trillion but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bushs presidency in order to sustain our economic expansion we must continue progrowth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government mr bush said in his budget message to congress mr bush has promised to halve the uss massive budget deficit within five years the deficit partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bushs presidency has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower the independent congressional budget office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than 200bn by 2009 returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012 but its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent in line with the promise when they were passed that they would sunset or disappear in 2010 most republicans however want them to stay in place and the figures also rely on the social security trust fund  the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions  being offset against the main budget deficit
