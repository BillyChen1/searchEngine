deadline nears for fiatgm deal

fiat and general motors gm have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover

the deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm part of an alliance agreed in 2000 gm whose own european operations are losing money no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 12% on tuesday after mondays 4% gain on hopes of a payoff the us firm is thought to be offering about 2bn 106bn to extricate itself from the arrangement it has argued the deal was voided by fiats decision to sell off fiats finance arm and halve gms stake via a capitalraising effort

the 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat the german firm wanted to buy fiat outright but gianni agnelli the godfather of the group wanted to keep control and preferred gms offer to buy a 20% stake and give fiat the right to sell in the future known as a put option since then however fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut gms stake in half to 10% for its part gms european units opel and saab have both had trouble with opel management threatening to cut 12000 jobs the last thing they need is additional production capacity in europe said patrick juchemich auto analyst at sal oppenheim bank
