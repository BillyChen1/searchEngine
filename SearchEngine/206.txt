standard life cuts policy bonuses

standard life europes largest mutual life insurer has cut bonuses for withprofit policyholders

annual bonus rates on its withprofits life policies were cut from 25% to 2% while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 325% to 25% it is the sixth time in three years standard life has made cuts to bonus rates despite an 87% rise in the value of the withprofits fund in 2004 the insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates

withprofits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies standard life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002 the insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered recently norwich union and axa sun life both cut their withprofit bonus rates

john gill managing director of the insurers life and pensions division said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002 in addition low interest rates meant that longterm investment returns are well below historic levels mr gill added however mr gill maintained that withprofits continued to perform well over the long term our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of longterm investments over similar periods he said standard life has an estimated 24 million withprofits policyholders last year the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006
