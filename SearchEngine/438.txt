uk interest rates held at 475%

the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 475% in a widelypredicted move

rates went up five times from november 2003  as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt  but have remained unchanged since august recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals and retail sales disappointed over christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence

rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers optimism causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium the brc said britains retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade

todays no change decision is correct said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce bcc but if there are clear signs that the economy slows the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending

mr frost added: the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain it is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an overabrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time

on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the office for national ons statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november  for the fifth month in the past six the ons said manufacturing output dropped 01% in november matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists expectations of a 03% rise manufacturers organisation the eef said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future it also said there was evidence that manufacturers confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain

so far the evidence suggests that last years rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said eef chief economist steve radley however should the business outlook start to deteriorate the bank should stand ready to cut rates some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens the bank remains concerned about the longterm risks posed by personal debt  which is rising at 15% a year  if economic conditions worsen
