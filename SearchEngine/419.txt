1m payoff for former shell boss

shell is to pay 1m 522000 to the exfinance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm overstated its reserves

judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer in january 2004 shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought shell said the payoff was in line with ms boyntons contract she was leaving by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities the firm said in a statement the severance package means she keeps longterm share options but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it

the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman sir phil watts and production chief walter van der vijver

an investigation commissioned by shell found that ms boynton had to share responsibility for the companys behaviour despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had fooled the market about its reserves the investigation said she did nothing to inquire further in all shell restated its reserves four times during 2003 in september it paid 827m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves
