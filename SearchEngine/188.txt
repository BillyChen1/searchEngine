qwest may spark mci bidding war

us phone company qwest has said it will table a new offer for mci after losing out to larger rival verizon setting the scene for a possible bidding war

mci accepted a 675bn 36bn buyout from telecoms giant verizon on monday rejecting a higher offer from qwest qwest chairman richard notebaert sent a letter to mcis board on thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining verizons bid formerly known as worldcom mci is a longdistance and corporate phone firm snapping up mci would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of businessbased subscribers shares of mci were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of new york markets

qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth 8bn we would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the verizon merger agreement we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire mci the letter from qwest said verizons offer is made up of cash shares and dividends and a number of investors have said that it undervalues mci verizon plans to swap 041 of its shares and 150 in cash for each mci share as well as offering special dividends of 450 a share both company boards have backed the deal but regulators will still need to give their approval as well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than verizons

the takeover would be the fifth billiondollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases earlier this month sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about 16bn there may be concerns other than cash however especially as mci only emerged from bankruptcy protection last april verizon is far bigger than qwest has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division also mci while trading under the name worldcom became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in us history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently standing trial accused of overseeing an 11bn fraud qwest meanwhile had to pay the securities and exchange commission 250m in october to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep wall street happy
