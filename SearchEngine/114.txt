speaking at the trial of his former boss bernard ebbers scott sullivan said he lied to the board to cover up the hole in worldcoms finances mr ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to worldcoms collapse in 2002 he pleads not guilty the firm had been overstating its accounts by 11bn 85bn mr sullivan 42 has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following mr ebbers trial where he is appearing as a prosecution witness mr ebbers 63 has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in worldcoms finances

in the new york court on wednesday mr ebbers lawyer reid weingarten asked mr sullivan: if you believe something is in your interest you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it isnt that right

on that date yes i was lying replied mr sullivan mr weingarten has suggested that mr sullivan is implicating mr ebbers only to win a lighter sentence something mr sullivan denies mr sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow worldcom board member bert roberts that mr ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at worldcom the trial of mr ebbers is now into its third week

under 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor mr sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned mr ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet wall street revenue and earnings expectations mr sullivan claims that mr ebbers refused to stop the fraud mr ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing worldcoms problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies prosecutors allege that the companys top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a twoyear period worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004 and is now known as mci
