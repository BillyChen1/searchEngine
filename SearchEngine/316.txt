euronext poised to make lse bid

paneuropean group euronext is poised to launch a bid for the london stock exchange uk media reports say

last week the lse rejected a takeover proposal from german rival deutsche boerse  the 530 penceashare offer valued the exchange at about 135bn the lse which saw its shares rise 25% said the bid undervalued the business euronext  formed after the brussels paris and amsterdam exchanges merged  is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer the lse europes biggest stock market is a key prize listing stocks with a total capitalisation of 14 trillion

euronext already has a presence in london due to its 2001 acquisition of londonbased options and futures exchange liffe trades on the lse are cleared via clearnet in which euronext has a quarter stake

euronext which also operates an exchange in lisbon last week appointed ubs and abn amro as additional advisors it is also working with morgan stanley despite the rejection of the deutsche boerse bid last week werner seifert chief executive of the frankfurtbased exchange may well come back with an improved offer it has long wanted to link up with london and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000 responding to the lses rebuff deutsche boerse  whose market capitalisation is more than 3bn  said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits and that it still hoped to make a cash bid

last week the lse said not only was the bid undervalued but that it had been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented however it has indicated it is open for further talks meanwhile german magazine der spiegel said part of mr seiferts negotiations with the lse were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange while mr seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of london the mayor of frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost german jobs many analysts believe german boerse has more financial firepower than euronext if it came to a bidding war
