business fears over sluggish eu economy

as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home  namely how to stay in business

lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce which stands beside the opera house and consider that it was built  like the town halls in many northern english towns  on the wealth created by coal steel and textiles like northern england and industrial scotland those industries have been in long term decline  the last coal pit closed in 1990 beckcrespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres about 20 miles from lille the company has not laid off a worker since 1945 it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry but not many of those are being built in europe these days

director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply while his key markets are now in china and india in our business the market is absolutely global you can not imagine living with our size of business even within an enlarged european union if we did that we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200 he says it isnt just globalisation that is hurting; the law in france means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours but at least there is still a steel industry coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling new business has been attracted but not enough to make up the difference

that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu says frederic sawicki a politics lecturer at the university of lille

in the region today the unemployment rate is 12% in some areas it is 15% they dont see what europe is doing for them so there is a kind of euro scepticism especially in the working classes he says which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe  if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world much of that trade passes through the worlds largest port rotterdam in holland home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer

boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home in the us growth is something like 6% in china they are estimating 15% and in the eu it is more or less 1% he says mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand he much preferred the old currencies of europe which moved in relation to each countrys economic performance in germany industry is exporting more these days but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2% in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years with germany making up a third of the eurozones economy this is a major problem if germany doesnt once again become the powerhouse of europe growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be however at one factory near the dutch border things are changing

the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2000 staff staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity by nearly 30% but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers says helmut schneider director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university labour is too costly in germany especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half he says the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010 four years into that process and the target seems further away than ever
