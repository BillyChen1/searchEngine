world leaders gather to face uncertainty

more than 2000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum wef for five days they will discuss issues ranging from chinas economic power to iraqs future after this sundays elections uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting unlike previous years protests against the wef are expected to be muted antiglobalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend

the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum timed to run in parallel with the wefs ritzier event in davos

the organisers of the brazilian gathering which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation for fair trade and many other causes have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit however many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well global warming features particularly high wef participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event davos itself is in deep frost the snow is piled high across the mountain village and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20c and less

ultimately the forum will be dominated by business issues  from outsourcing to corporate leadership  with bosses of more than a fifth of the worlds 500 largest companies scheduled to attend

but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos not least because the agenda of this years forum seems to lack an overarching theme taking responsibility for tough choices is this years official talking point hinting at a welter of knotty problems one thing seems sure though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with iran iraq and china are set to dominate discussions pointedly only one senior official from president bushs new administration is scheduled to attend the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos

ukraines new president viktor yushchenko is to speak just days after his inauguration an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power

the european unions top leaders among them german chancellor gerhard schroeder and european commission president manuel barosso will be here too mr blair will formally open the proceedings although his speech will be preempted by french president jacques chirac who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a special message two hours before mr blair speaks the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader mahmoud abbas will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event a list that includes shimon peres davos fans still hark back to 1994 when talks between yassir arafat and mr peres came close to a peace deal mr blairs appearance will be keenly watched too as political observers in the uk claim it is a calculated snub against political rival chancellor gordon brown who was supposed to lead the uk government delegation

microsoft founder bill gates the worlds richest man and a regular at davos will focus on campaigning for good causes though business interests will not be wholly absent either having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases on tuesday mr gates pledged 750m 400m of his own money to support the cause mr gates company software giant microsoft also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux which threaten microsofts near monopoly on computer desktops mr gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with brazils president lula da silva the brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from microsoft to linux at davos global problem solving and networking are never far apart
