europe blames us over weak dollar

european leaders have openly blamed the us for the sharp rise in the value of the euro

us officials were talking up the dollar they said but failing to take action to back up their words meeting in brussels finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports the dollar is within touching distance of an alltime low reached earlier in november at 0619 gmt on tuesday the dollar was up slightly at just above 129 to the euro and buying 1056 yen in tokyo it rallied briefly on monday amid signs that oil prices are easing

but analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary the european ministers comments said junya tanase of jpmorgan chase bank in tokyo were generally too weak to produce a market reaction

still by the standards of diplomacy the european ministers were forthright nicolas sarkozy of france said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit europes economies by eating into their exports we are concerned about these developments which are destabilising and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our american friends he said the comments come a day after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was in americas interest

but that was not enough for mr sarkozy

if the americans were to change their policy its up to them to say so he said and the european unions monetary affairs commissioner made it clear that action was necessary i fully welcome the words of mr snow said joaquin almunia but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction if the imbalances in the us economy are not adjusted in the future the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks economists point out that whatever europe says in the short term a weaker dollar is a boon to president george w bushs administration not only does it boost us exports but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund on the other hand slower european exports would mean slower eu growth  potentially reducing the demand for us goods
