wembley firm wont make a profit

shares in multiplex group which is building the new wembley stadium fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project

the australian firm said it would only break even on the 12bn australian dollars 458m; 874m rebuild after a rise in costs on the work any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor it added it cut a68m from profit targets for wembley and another uk project

investors were shaken by the news and the firms shares fell to a four month low of a450 before recovering to close 16% down at a467 the decline came despite multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pretax profits to a677m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts increased costs at wembley and a separate development in londons docklands saw multiplexs construction division report profits of a351m

the firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its uk projects  which also include the white city redevelopment scheme in west london  were performing strongly

to recoup any profit from wembley where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors these claims could take up to two years to resolve multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position it said it is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised wembley stadium is to due to be completed in january and will officially open for the 2006 fa cup final analysts expressed concern at the unexpected paring back in profit such a big writeback on the wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility simon wheatley from goldman sachs told reuters
