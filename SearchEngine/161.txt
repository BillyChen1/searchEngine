exboeing director gets jail term

an exchief financial officer at lockheed boeing has received a fourmonth jail sentence and a fine of 250000 131961 for illegally hiring a top air force aide

michael sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting darleen druyun while she still handled military contracts ms druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring boeing when awarding lucrative contracts boeing lost a 23bn government contract after a pentagon inquiry into the case the contract to provide refuelling tankers for the us air force was cancelled last year

the pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth 3bn which it believes may have been tainted by ms druyuns role in the procurement process boeing sacked mr sears and ms druyun in november 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy ms druyun had talks with mr sears in october 2002 about working for boeing while she was still a top procurement machinery official within the pentagon she subsequently joined the company in january 2003 ms druyun admitted that she had steered multibillion dollar contracts to boeing and other favoured companies

in documents filed in a virginia court ahead of mr sears sentencing prosecutors blamed boeings senior management for failing to ask key questions about the legal and ethical issues surrounding ms druyuns appointment mr sears told prosecutors that no other boeing officials were aware that ms druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with boeing however analysts believe boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal the pentagon has investigated 400 contracts dating back to 1993 since the allegations against ms druyun came to light

boeings corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years boeing was sued by lockheed martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition boeing machinery apologised publicly for the affair  although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage  and pledged to improve its procedures the pentagon subsequently revoked 1bn worth of contracts assigned to boeing and prohibited the seattlebased company from future rocket work
