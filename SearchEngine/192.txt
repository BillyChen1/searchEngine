yukos bankruptcy not us matter

russian authorities do not have to abide by any us court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant yukos a houston court has been told

legal expert william butler said there was no treaty between the us and russia to recognise the others legal rulings that meant moscow would not have to adhere to us rulings in the yukos case yukos says a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold since it has a us subsidiary and local bank accounts

yukos made its surprise chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in houston in december in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of yugansk its main oil producing unit by russian authorities yugansk was sold to help pay off a 275bn 145bn back tax bill it was bought for 94bn by a previously unknown group which was in turn bought by statecontrolled oil company rosneft the us courts jurisdiction has been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft deutsche bank maintains the case has no place in a us court because yukos has no assets in the us apart from two bank accounts and a house in houston owned by its chief finance officer bruce misamore deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos it had agreed to loan gazpromneft the money to bid for yugansk us bankruptcy judge letitia clark who issued an injunction in december to try and prevent the yugansk sale has said she will rule pretty promptly however i do not anticipate ruling on it before next tuesday

yukos has claimed it sought help in the us because other forums  russian courts and the european court of human rights  were either unfriendly or offered less protection it has claimed that russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of yugansk as part of a campaign to destroy yukos and its former owner mihkail khodorkovsky who is facing a 10year prison term in russia for fraud and tax evasion yukos parent company the gibraltarbased menatep group is suing russia in europe for 283bn in financial damages the company is also seeking 20bn in a separate us lawsuit against rosneft and gazprom for their role in the sale of yugansk
