bp surges ahead on high oil price

oil giant bp has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to 162bn 87bn on the back of record oil prices

last week rival shell reported an annual profit of 175bn  a record profit for a uklisted company bp added that it was increasing its fourthquarter dividend by 26% to 85 cents and that it would continue with share buybacks bp chief executive lord browne said the results were strong both operationally and financially

the company is earning about 18m an hour

despite the record annual profits figure bps performance was below the expectations of some city analysts however bps share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p its profit rise for the year included profits of 365bn 197bn for the final three months of 2004  up from 289bn a year ago but below its third quarter

speaking on the bbcs today programme on tuesday lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone

the profits are up more than the price of oil is up he said lord browne pointed out that bp was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration we have spent many years buying assets when the price is low he said the company has made new discoveries in egypt the gulf of mexico and angola

however lord browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his companys huge profits saying that in the north sea it paid progressively more tax the more profits it made lord browne believes oil prices will remain quite high currently above 40 a barrel he said: the price of oil will be well supported above 30 a barrel for the medium term bp put production for the year at 3997 billion barrels of oil up 10% on 2003 but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for
