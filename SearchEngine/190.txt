consumers drive french economy

frances economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004 driven by consumer spending a report shows

gross domestic product gdp rose by 08% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period the statistical office insee said that expansion pushed annual growth to 23% the fastest rate in two years consumer spending was up by 12% in the fourth quarter and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove

analysts warned that france still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace

france still has a strong economic growth said marc toutai an economist at natexis banques populaires but if we check the figures in detail theres a problem consumer spending is still high but french households have spent their savings to consume france cant sustain a high growth rate without an improvement in the job market theres too much of a gap between growth and employment unemployment levels are currently stuck at about 10% and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts another worry is that demand in germany and italy two of frances main trading partners is sluggish

despite the concerns analysts pointed out that france was outperforming the majority of its european counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years as well as strong domestic demand exports climbed by 13% in the fourth quarter  the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year its an economic growth that seems well balanced said nicolas claquin an analyst at ccf in the beginning of 2004 growth was mainly driven by consumer spending here it gets contributions from investment and exports though household consumption is still strong but we expect overall economic growth to fall to 20 percent in 2005
