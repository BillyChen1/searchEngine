worldcom bosses 54m payout

ten former directors at worldcom have agreed to pay 54m 2885m including 18m from their own pockets to settle a class action lawsuit reports say

james wareham a lawyer representing one of the directors told reuters the 10 had agreed to pay those who lost billions when the firm collapsed the remaining 36m will be paid by the directors insurers but a spokesman for the prosecutor new york state comptroller alan hevesi said no formal agreement had been made

corporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses when the firms they oversee face problems

directors very rarely pay said charles elson chairman of the center for corporate governance at the university of delaware he added that the settlement sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world a formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on thursday in a us district court in manhattan earlier the new york times had reported that the personal payments were required as part of any deal at the start of negotiations the ten former outside directors are james allen judith areen carl aycock max bobbitt clifford alexander stiles kellett gordon macklin john porter lawrence tucker and the estate of john sidgmore who died last year it has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay none of the 10 former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the worldcom fraud said the wall street journal wsj
