us adds more jobs than expected

the us economy added 337000 jobs in october  a sevenmonth high and far more than wall street expectations

in a welcome economic boost for newly reelected president george w bush the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains jobs were created in every sector of the us economy except manufacturing while the separate unemployment rate went up to 55% from 54% in september this was because more people were now actively seeking work

the 337000 new jobs added to us payrolls in october was twice the 169000 figure that wall street economists had forecast in addition the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months  to 139000 in september instead of 96000 and to 198000 in august instead of 128000 the better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in new york with the main dow jones index gaining 454 points to 10360 by late morning trading it looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year said economist gary thayer of ag edwards & sons

other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the us federal reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week it should empower the fed to clearly do something said robert macintosh chief economist with eaton vance management in boston kathleen utgoff commissioner of the bureau of labor said many of the 71000 new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and cleanup work in florida and neighbouring deep south states following four hurricanes in august and september the dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro as investors returned their attention to other economic factors such as the uss record trade deficit there is also speculation that president bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports
