disaster claims less than 10bn

insurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least 38000 people in southern asia

munich re and swiss re the worlds two biggest reinsurers have said exposure will be less than for other disasters rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries and many of those affected will not have insurance analysts said swiss re has said total claims are likely to be less than 10bn 517bn swiss re believes that the cost would be substantial but that it is unlikely to be in doubledigit billions the financial times reported munich re the worlds largest reinsurance company said that its exposure is less than 100m euros 70m; 136m

at least 10 countries have been affected with sri lanka indonesia india and thailand among the worst hit the regions resorts and western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants

lloyds of london told the financial times it expected its exposure to be limited to holiday resorts personal accident travel insurance and marine risks a spokeswoman for hanover re europes fifthlargest reinsurance firm estimated tsunamirelated damage claims would be in the low doubledigit millions of euros the company has paid out about 300 million euros 281m; 400m to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the us

but insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through

so many things are unclear it is just too early to tell said serge troeber deputy head of swiss res natural disasters department you need very complicated processes to estimate damages unlike the hurricanes you cant just run a model he anticipated that his own companys total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes which the company put at 640m allianz a leading german insurer said it did not know yet what its exposure would be however it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a significant impact on its business zurich financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster

the impact on us insurance companies is not expected to be heavy analysts said

most us insurers have relatively little exposure to asia and those that do pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds insured damage could be a fraction of the billions of dollars worth of destruction in sri lanka india thailand indonesia the maldive islands and malaysia said prudential equity group insurance analyst jay gelb us insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure its more likely the bermudabased reinsurance companies might have some exposure said paul newsome an insurance analyst at ag edwards & co

many of the affected countries such as indonesia sri lanka or the maldives do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters said a usbased insurance expert early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including sri lanka india indonesia and thailand at about 5bn 26bn similar to the cash offered to central america after hurricane mitch

mitch killed about 10000 people and caused damage of about 10bn in 1998 but the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is incalculable we cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages  that have just been wiped out hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone said jan egeland head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too the association of british insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday it said loss of possessions will usually be covered but the association stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies
