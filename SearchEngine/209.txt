the board of man utd is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal from the us tycoon that values the club at 800m 15bn manchester united revealed on sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from mr glazer a senior source at the club told the bbc: this time its different the board is obliged to consider this deal but the man utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal manchester united past and present footballers eric cantona and ole gunnar solskjaer and club manager sir alex ferguson have lent their backing to the supporters group shareholders united they have all spoken out against the bid

a spokesman for the supporters club said: i cant see any difference compared to mr glazers previous proposals other than 200m less debt he isnt bringing any money into the club; hell use our money to buy it

mr glazers latest move is being led by mr glazers two sons avi and joel according to the financial times a proposal was received by david gill uniteds chief executive at the end of last week pitched at about 300p a share david cummings head of uk equities for standard life investments said he believed a well funded 300p a share bid would be enough for mr glazer to take control of the club i do not think there is anything that manchester united fans can do about it he told the bbc they can complain about it but it is curtains for them they may not want him but they are going to get him the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed

mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted he is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal though it is not clear by how much for his proposal to succeed he needs the support of uniteds largest shareholders the irish horseracing tycoons jp mcmanus and john magnier they own 29% of united through their cubic expression investment vehicle mr glazer and his family hold a stake of 281% but it is not yet known whether mr mcmanus and mr magnier would support a glazer bid nm rothschild the investment bank is advising mr glazer according to the financial times his previous adviser jpmorgan quit last year when mr glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three united directors to the board against its advice but the ft said it thought jp morgan may still have had some role in financing mr glazers latest financial proposal
