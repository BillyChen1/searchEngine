train strike grips buenos aires

a strike on the buenos aires underground has caused traffic chaos and large queues at bus stops in the argentine capital

tube workers walked out last week demanding a 53% pay rise and in protest against the installation of automatic ticket machines metrovias the private firm which runs the five tube lines in the city has offered an 8% increase in wages the firm promised no jobs would be lost as a result of new ticket machines it said it would put this commitment on paper

underground staff have warned they will continue with the protests until the management put an acceptable offer on the table the argentine work ministry has been mediating in the conflict and it could call an obligatory conciliation which would force both sides to find a solution and put an end to the conflict some tube commuters have not hidden their frustration at the ongoing strike and have broken the windows of the underground trains according to the local press we are taken as hostages i dont know who is right but the harm ones are us said accountant jose lopez
