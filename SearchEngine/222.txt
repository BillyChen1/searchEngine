oil companies get russian setback

international oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to russias decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005

us oil giant exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement miner highland gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while bp a big investor declined to comment only firms at least 51% russianowned will be permitted to bid

the federal natural resources agency said the government is interested in letting russian companies develop strategic resources the foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to russias competition law natural resources minister yuri trutnev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency no further details were given with mr trutnev suggesting that russia may decide on a casebycase basis observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy as the administration of vladimir putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stockmarket listed company yukos a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors

analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals

companies echoed this sentiment saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells its not good but it is very understandable said al breach an economist at ubs brunswick but if the investment climate is stable  thats much more important foreigners of course would like to have free entry but this is not the end of the world a number of other nations including mexico saudi arabia and kuwait protect their national resources from foreign firms what has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism russia has been courting foreign investment

bp spent 75bn to create russianregistered oil company tnkbp and has a partnership to develop the sakhalin 5 petroleum field with stateowned rosneft exxon the worlds largest oil company has signed preliminary agreements to develop the sakhalin 3 field company spokesman gold glenn waller said exxon still considered the deal valid despite russia inviting new offers for the land block according to mr waller exxon were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway we regret the ministry has taken such a decision said ivan kulakov deputy chairman of highland gold  a mining firm that has the motto bringing russias gold to market it would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate other firms that have been linked with investment in russia include frances total the usbased chevrontexaco and miner barrick gold
