irish duo could block man utd bid

irishmen jp mcmanus and john magnier who own a 29% stake in manchester united will reportedly reject any formal 800m offer for the club

the sunday times and the sunday telegraph say they will oppose any formal 800m takeover bid from us tycoon malcom glazer mr glazer got permission to look at the clubs accounts last week irish billionaires mr mcmanus and mr magnier are said to believe that an 800m bid undervalues club prospects

mr magnier and mr mcmanus who hold their stake through their cubic expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid mr glazers financial backers including jp morgan the us investment bank have said they wont back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the clubs shares however there has been much speculation that the irish duo simply do not think the price offered  300p a share  is high enough mr glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003

mr magnier and mr mcmanus issued a statement late on friday saying that they remained longterm investors in man utd the sunday telegraph says the board of manchester united also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it
