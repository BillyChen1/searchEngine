home loan approvals rising again

the number of mortgages approved in the uk has risen for the first time since may last year according to lending figures from the bank of england

new loans in december rose to 83000 slightly higher than novembers nineyear low of 77000 mortgage lending rose by 71bn in december up from a 64bn rise in november the figures contradict a survey from the british bankers association which said approvals were at a fiveyear low

analysts say the figures show the market may be stabilising but still point to further house price softness the modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in december reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply said global insight analyst howard archer commenting on the boes figures the bba believes that the property market is continuing to cool down changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in november thus flattering the december figures analysts said in october last year new rules came into force which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in november and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly separately the bank of england said that consumer credit rose by 15bn in december more than the 14bn expected and above the 14bn reported in the previous month
